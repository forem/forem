# The show route now handles the conventional "by id" lookup as well as by `username` (original way),
# so nested resources look up a param called organization_id_or_slug for now. (`username` is an alias for `slug`)
# Later on we may wish to refactor to a show route (and namespace for nested routes)
# that assumes an id has been given but can lookup by username if a query param is provided.
# however, this might cause friction with a consumer accustomed to lookups by username,
# so we may want to communicate such a change in advance before implementing it.
