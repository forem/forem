##
# This module is providing a "crease in the code" for refactoring.
# The initial purpose is to help move away sending `has_role?`
# messages to User records.  Prior to this refactor, there were calls
# to `user.has_role?(:tech_admin)` and `user.tech_admin?`; this
# created leaks in abstraction (see
# Authorizer::RoleBasedQueries#admin? for an example).
#
# By moving towards a single entry point and communicating that
# deprecation, the hope is to make the next conversation about roles
# easier.
module Authorizer
  # @api private
  #
  # @note This method introduces some indirection, the idea being that
  #       the `Authorizer::RoleBasedQueries` is a refactor to convey
  #       deprecations and provide guidance on sending things through
  #       a common method pattern (e.g. favor `user.tech_admin?` over
  #       `user.has_role?(:tech_admin)`).
  #
  # @param user [User] the user of whom we're curious about their
  #        attributes and how the imply permissions.

  def self.for(user:)

  # @api private

  # This class is responsible for assisting in moving us away from
  # `user.some_property_for_permissions?`.
