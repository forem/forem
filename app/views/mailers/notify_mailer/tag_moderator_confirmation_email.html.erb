<p>
  Hey <%= @user.name %>!
</p>
<p>
  Thanks for volunteering to be a <%= community_name %> tag moderator. We’ve added you as a moderator for
  <a href="<%= tag_url(@tag) %>"><%= @tag.name %></a>. You’re currently the only non-core <%= community_name %> member that’s moderating this tag. Over time, we’ll add additional mods to join you because we view moderation as a collaborative endeavor that benefits from the support of multiple people.
</p>
<p>
  As a tag moderator, you are now able to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Remove the tag if it’s been added to an irrelevant post.
  </li>
  <li>
    Update the the tag sidebar.
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For details on how to access these features, visit our
  <a href="<%= app_url("/tag-moderation") %>">tag moderation</a> page.</strong></p>
<p>
  To aid in communication, we’ve added you to a tag moderator
  <a href="<%= app_url("/connect/tag-moderators") %>"><%= community_name %> Connect channel</a>. You can use this channel to meet other tag moderators across site, and to coordinate with the <%= community_name %> team. When in doubt about how to exercise your new privileges, please ask!
</p>
<p>
  Tag moderation is still very much in beta, so we’ll be making adjustments and expanding features over time as we receive feedback.
</p>
<p>Thanks for volunteering your time to benefit the <%= community_qualified_name %>.</p>
<p>
  Happy Coding!
  <br>
  - <%= community_name %> Team
