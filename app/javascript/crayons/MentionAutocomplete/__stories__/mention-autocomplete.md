## Mention Autocomplete

_This component is a work in progress_

The mention autocomplete component uses the [Reach UI Combobox](https://reach.tech/combobox/) under the hood. It can be used for searching for users by username by passing in the relevant network call as the `fetchSuggestions` prop.

As a general rule, no more than 6 suggestions should be shown at a time.
