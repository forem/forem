# Tabs

## What exactly?
Tabs navigations is supposed to allow users to navigate easily between views within the same context.
Tabs component is responsible only for dipslaying Tabs-like navigation (controls). 
This component is **not** supposed to handle displaying tabbed content (literally switching between tab panels).

## Buttons vs Links
Depending on your use case, you may want to either use Buttons or Links for individual tabs. 
Therefore, individual `<Tab />` elements will inherit props for either Buttons or Links, respectively.

## Usage

Nielsen Norman Groups has a great [resource about using tabs correctly](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/tabs-used-right/).
Below you can find couple rules of thumb.

### Short labels
Write short tab labels and use plain language, rather than made-up terms. Tab labels should usually be 1–2 words.
Short labels are more scannable; if you need longer labels, it’s a sign that the choices are too complicated for a tab control.

### Number of tabs

Keep number of tabs limitied. Even though we don't have any defined constraint here, it's probably wise to never exceed 5 or 6 tabs. 
This maintains an uncluttered UI and reduces cognitive load for users. If you think more tabs is needed, then you should yell at your designer.

### Tabs are not inputs

Tabs component should never be considered as Form control, for example acting like radio buttons. 
So don't treat it as another input or part of your Form.

### Provide current state

Individual `<Tab />` can have `current` prop which defines currently selected (active) tab. Always have **one** `<Tab current />` at a time.

Rememeber that "**current**" (aka *active*, aka *selected*) is defined differently:

- For JSX add `current` prop to appropriate tab.
- For HTML:
    - For `<button>` tabs you need to use `aria-pressed="true"` attribute for *current* tab and `aria-pressed="false"` for the rest.
    - For `<a>` tabs you only need to use `aria-current="page"` attribute for *current* tab.

### JSX
In JSX world you just need to define your `elements` prop to be `buttons` or `links` and appropriate code will be handled automatically.

- For `buttons`, individual `<Tab />` elements will turn into `<Button />`. Keep in mind to add `onClick` attribute (or anything else that will handle actual navigation).
- For `links`, individual `<Tab />` elements will turn into `<Link />`. Keep in mind to add `href` attribute.

Both come with slightly different styling (mostly for `:hover` effects) and in both cases it is possible to use their respective props.

### HTML
In HTML world, after defininig appropriate `elements` prop in Controls panel (in Storybook) you can generate HTML snippet that will contain either `<button>` or `<a>` elements.

## Scrollable container

Tabs component is, by default, *scorllable* which means that user will be able to scroll through tabs once there's not enough horizontal space to fit them all.
Keep in mind that this should only be a case for mobile breakpoint. Because if you end up having scorllable tabs on desktop breakpoint then you should definitely talk to your designer.

## Configuration

### Stacked tabs

Tabs come in horizontal orientation by default. There's a setting for stacking them, one on top of another:
- For JSX it's just `stacked` prop.
- For HTML it's `c-tabs--stacked` class.

Keep in mind that stacked (vertical) tabs will turn into horizontal on the smallest breakpoint, automatically.

### Fitted layout

Tabs can take full available space (for 2 tabs: each will be 1/2 of the container, for 3 tabs: each will be 1/3 of the container, and so on). 
To turn this on:
- For JSX add `stacked` prop.
- For HTML add `c-tabs--fitted` class.
