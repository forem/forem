# The RuboCop Community Code of Conduct

**Note:** We have picked the following code of conduct based on [Ruby's own
code of conduct](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/conduct/).

This document provides a few simple community guidelines for a safe, respectful,
productive, and collaborative place for any person who is willing to contribute
to the RuboCop community. It applies to all "collaborative spaces", which are
defined as community communications channels (such as mailing lists, submitted
patches, commit comments, etc.).

- Participants will be tolerant of opposing views.
- Participants must ensure that their language and actions are free of personal
  attacks and disparaging personal remarks.
- When interpreting the words and actions of others, participants should always
  assume good intentions.
- Behaviour which can be reasonably considered harassment will not be tolerated.
