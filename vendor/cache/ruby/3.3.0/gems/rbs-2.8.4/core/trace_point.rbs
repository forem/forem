# Document-class: TracePoint
#
# A class that provides the functionality of Kernel#set_trace_func in a nice
# Object-Oriented API.
#
# ## Example
#
# We can use TracePoint to gather information specifically for exceptions:
#
#     trace = TracePoint.new(:raise) do |tp|
#         p [tp.lineno, tp.event, tp.raised_exception]
#     end
#     #=> #<TracePoint:disabled>
#
#     trace.enable
#     #=> false
#
#     0 / 0
#     #=> [5, :raise, #<ZeroDivisionError: divided by 0>]
#
# ## Events
#
# If you don't specify the type of events you want to listen for, TracePoint
# will include all available events.
#
# **Note** do not depend on current event set, as this list is subject to
# change. Instead, it is recommended you specify the type of events you want to
# use.
#
# To filter what is traced, you can pass any of the following as `events`:
#
# `:line`
# :   execute an expression or statement on a new line
# `:class`
# :   start a class or module definition
# `:end`
# :   finish a class or module definition
# `:call`
# :   call a Ruby method
# `:return`
# :   return from a Ruby method
# `:c_call`
# :   call a C-language routine
# `:c_return`
# :   return from a C-language routine
# `:raise`
# :   raise an exception
# `:b_call`
# :   event hook at block entry
# `:b_return`
# :   event hook at block ending
# `:a_call`
# :   event hook at all calls (`call`, `b_call`, and `c_call`)
# `:a_return`
# :   event hook at all returns (`return`, `b_return`, and `c_return`)
# `:thread_begin`
# :   event hook at thread beginning
# `:thread_end`
# :   event hook at thread ending
# `:fiber_switch`
# :   event hook at fiber switch
# `:script_compiled`
# :   new Ruby code compiled (with `eval`, `load` or `require`)
#
