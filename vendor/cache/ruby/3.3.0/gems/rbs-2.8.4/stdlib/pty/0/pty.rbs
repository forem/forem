# Creates and manages pseudo terminals (PTYs).  See also
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo_terminal
#
# PTY allows you to allocate new terminals using ::open or ::spawn a new
# terminal with a specific command.
#
# ## Example
#
# In this example we will change the buffering type in the `factor` command,
# assuming that factor uses stdio for stdout buffering.
#
# If IO.pipe is used instead of PTY.open, this code deadlocks because factor's
# stdout is fully buffered.
#
#     # start by requiring the standard library PTY
#     require 'pty'
#
#     master, slave = PTY.open
#     read, write = IO.pipe
#     pid = spawn("factor", :in=>read, :out=>slave)
#     read.close     # we dont need the read
#     slave.close    # or the slave
#
#     # pipe "42" to the factor command
#     write.puts "42"
#     # output the response from factor
#     p master.gets #=> "42: 2 3 7\n"
#
#     # pipe "144" to factor and print out the response
#     write.puts "144"
#     p master.gets #=> "144: 2 2 2 2 3 3\n"
#     write.close # close the pipe
#
#     # The result of read operation when pty slave is closed is platform
#     # dependent.
#     ret = begin
#             master.gets     # FreeBSD returns nil.
#           rescue Errno::EIO # GNU/Linux raises EIO.
#             nil
#           end
#     p ret #=> nil

  # Checks the status of the child process specified by `pid`. Returns `nil` if
  # the process is still alive.
  #
  # If the process is not alive, and `raise` was true, a PTY::ChildExited
  # exception will be raised. Otherwise it will return a Process::Status instance.
  #
  # `pid`
  # :   The process id of the process to check
  # `raise`
  # :   If `true` and the process identified by `pid` is no longer alive a
  #     PTY::ChildExited is raised.

  # ### Return values
  #

  # In the block form these same values will be yielded to the block:

  # :   A writable IO that is the command's standard input
  # `pid`
  # :   The process identifier for the command.
