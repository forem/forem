# ## Overview
#
# The Common Gateway Interface (CGI) is a simple protocol for passing an HTTP
# request from a web server to a standalone program, and returning the output to
# the web browser.  Basically, a CGI program is called with the parameters of
# the request passed in either in the environment (GET) or via $stdin (POST),
# and everything it prints to $stdout is returned to the client.
#
# This file holds the CGI class.  This class provides functionality for
# retrieving HTTP request parameters, managing cookies, and generating HTML
# output.
#
# The file CGI::Session provides session management functionality; see that
# class for more details.
#
# See http://www.w3.org/CGI/ for more information on the CGI protocol.
#
# ## Introduction
#
# CGI is a large class, providing several categories of methods, many of which
# are mixed in from other modules.  Some of the documentation is in this class,
# some in the modules CGI::QueryExtension and CGI::HtmlExtension.  See
# CGI::Cookie for specific information on handling cookies, and cgi/session.rb
# (CGI::Session) for information on sessions.
#
# For queries, CGI provides methods to get at environmental variables,
# parameters, cookies, and multipart request data.  For responses, CGI provides
# methods for writing output and generating HTML.
#
# Read on for more details.  Examples are provided at the bottom.
#
# ## Queries
#
# The CGI class dynamically mixes in parameter and cookie-parsing functionality,
#  environmental variable access, and support for parsing multipart requests
# (including uploaded files) from the CGI::QueryExtension module.
#
# ### Environmental Variables
#
# The standard CGI environmental variables are available as read-only attributes
# of a CGI object.  The following is a list of these variables:
#
#     AUTH_TYPE               HTTP_HOST          REMOTE_IDENT
#     CONTENT_LENGTH          HTTP_NEGOTIATE     REMOTE_USER
#     CONTENT_TYPE            HTTP_PRAGMA        REQUEST_METHOD
#     GATEWAY_INTERFACE       HTTP_REFERER       SCRIPT_NAME
#     HTTP_ACCEPT             HTTP_USER_AGENT    SERVER_NAME
#     HTTP_ACCEPT_CHARSET     PATH_INFO          SERVER_PORT
#     HTTP_ACCEPT_ENCODING    PATH_TRANSLATED    SERVER_PROTOCOL
#     HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE    QUERY_STRING       SERVER_SOFTWARE
#     HTTP_CACHE_CONTROL      REMOTE_ADDR
#     HTTP_FROM               REMOTE_HOST
#
# For each of these variables, there is a corresponding attribute with the same
# name, except all lower case and without a preceding HTTP_. `content_length`
# and `server_port` are integers; the rest are strings.
#
# ### Parameters
#
# The method #params() returns a hash of all parameters in the request as
# name/value-list pairs, where the value-list is an Array of one or more values.
#  The CGI object itself also behaves as a hash of parameter names to values,
# but only returns a single value (as a String) for each parameter name.
#
# For instance, suppose the request contains the parameter "favourite_colours"
# with the multiple values "blue" and "green".  The following behavior would
# occur:
#
#     cgi.params["favourite_colours"]  # => ["blue", "green"]
#     cgi["favourite_colours"]         # => "blue"
#
# If a parameter does not exist, the former method will return an empty array,
# the latter an empty string.  The simplest way to test for existence of a
# parameter is by the #has_key? method.
#
# ### Cookies
#
# HTTP Cookies are automatically parsed from the request.  They are available
# from the #cookies() accessor, which returns a hash from cookie name to
# CGI::Cookie object.
#
# ### Multipart requests
#
# If a request's method is POST and its content type is multipart/form-data,
# then it may contain uploaded files.  These are stored by the QueryExtension
# module in the parameters of the request.  The parameter name is the name
# attribute of the file input field, as usual.  However, the value is not a
# string, but an IO object, either an IOString for small files, or a Tempfile
# for larger ones.  This object also has the additional singleton methods:
#
# #local_path()
# :   the path of the uploaded file on the local filesystem
# #original_filename()
# :   the name of the file on the client computer
# #content_type()
# :   the content type of the file
#
#
# ## Responses
#
# The CGI class provides methods for sending header and content output to the
# HTTP client, and mixes in methods for programmatic HTML generation from
# CGI::HtmlExtension and CGI::TagMaker modules.  The precise version of HTML to
# use for HTML generation is specified at object creation time.
#
# ### Writing output
#
# The simplest way to send output to the HTTP client is using the #out() method.
# This takes the HTTP headers as a hash parameter, and the body content via a
# block.  The headers can be generated as a string using the #http_header()
# method.  The output stream can be written directly to using the #print()
# method.
#
# ### Generating HTML
#
# Each HTML element has a corresponding method for generating that element as a
# String.  The name of this method is the same as that of the element, all
# lowercase.  The attributes of the element are passed in as a hash, and the
# body as a no-argument block that evaluates to a String.  The HTML generation
# module knows which elements are always empty, and silently drops any passed-in
# body.  It also knows which elements require matching closing tags and which
# don't.  However, it does not know what attributes are legal for which
# elements.
#
# There are also some additional HTML generation methods mixed in from the
# CGI::HtmlExtension module.  These include individual methods for the different
# types of form inputs, and methods for elements that commonly take particular
# attributes where the attributes can be directly specified as arguments, rather
# than via a hash.
#
# ### Utility HTML escape and other methods like a function.
#
# There are some utility tool defined in cgi/util.rb . And when include, you can
# use utility methods like a function.
#
# ## Examples of use
#
# ### Get form values
#
#     require "cgi"
#     cgi = CGI.new
#     value = cgi['field_name']   # <== value string for 'field_name'
#       # if not 'field_name' included, then return "".
#     fields = cgi.keys            # <== array of field names
#
#     # returns true if form has 'field_name'
#     cgi.has_key?('field_name')
#     cgi.has_key?('field_name')
#     cgi.include?('field_name')
#
# CAUTION! `cgi['field_name']` returned an Array with the old cgi.rb(included in
# Ruby 1.6)
#
# ### Get form values as hash
#
#     require "cgi"
#     cgi = CGI.new
#     params = cgi.params
#
# cgi.params is a hash.
#
#     cgi.params['new_field_name'] = ["value"]  # add new param
#     cgi.params['field_name'] = ["new_value"]  # change value
#     cgi.params.delete('field_name')           # delete param
#     cgi.params.clear                          # delete all params
#
# ### Save form values to file
#
#     require "pstore"
#     db = PStore.new("query.db")
#     db.transaction do
#       db["params"] = cgi.params
#     end
#
# ### Restore form values from file
#
#     require "pstore"
#     db = PStore.new("query.db")
#     db.transaction do
#       cgi.params = db["params"]
#     end
#
# ### Get multipart form values
#
#     require "cgi"
#     cgi = CGI.new
#     value = cgi['field_name']   # <== value string for 'field_name'
#     value.read                  # <== body of value
#     value.local_path            # <== path to local file of value
#     value.original_filename     # <== original filename of value
#     value.content_type          # <== content_type of value
#
# and value has StringIO or Tempfile class methods.
#
# ### Get cookie values
#
#     require "cgi"
#     cgi = CGI.new
#     values = cgi.cookies['name']  # <== array of 'name'
#       # if not 'name' included, then return [].
#     names = cgi.cookies.keys      # <== array of cookie names
#
# and cgi.cookies is a hash.
#
# ### Get cookie objects
#
#     require "cgi"
#     cgi = CGI.new
#     for name, cookie in cgi.cookies
#       cookie.expires = Time.now + 30
#     end
#     cgi.out("cookie" => cgi.cookies) {"string"}
#
#     cgi.cookies # { "name1" => cookie1, "name2" => cookie2, ... }
#
#     require "cgi"
#     cgi = CGI.new
#     cgi.cookies['name'].expires = Time.now + 30
#     cgi.out("cookie" => cgi.cookies['name']) {"string"}
#
# ### Print http header and html string to $DEFAULT_OUTPUT ($>)
#
#     require "cgi"
#     cgi = CGI.new("html4")  # add HTML generation methods
#     cgi.out do
#       cgi.html do
#         cgi.head do
#           cgi.title { "TITLE" }
#         end +
#         cgi.body do
#           cgi.form("ACTION" => "uri") do
#             cgi.p do
#               cgi.textarea("get_text") +
#               cgi.br +
#               cgi.submit
#             end
#           end +
#           cgi.pre do
#             CGI.escapeHTML(
#               "params: #{cgi.params.inspect}\n" +
#               "cookies: #{cgi.cookies.inspect}\n" +
#               ENV.collect do |key, value|
#                 "#{key} --> #{value}\n"
#               end.join("")
#             )
#           end
#         end
#       end
#     end
#
#     # add HTML generation methods
#     CGI.new("html3")    # html3.2
#     CGI.new("html4")    # html4.01 (Strict)
#     CGI.new("html4Tr")  # html4.01 Transitional
#     CGI.new("html4Fr")  # html4.01 Frameset
#     CGI.new("html5")    # html5
#
# ### Some utility methods
#
#     require 'cgi/util'
#     CGI.escapeHTML('Usage: foo "bar" <baz>')
#
# ### Some utility methods like a function
#
#     require 'cgi/util'
#     include CGI::Util
#     escapeHTML('Usage: foo "bar" <baz>')
#     h('Usage: foo "bar" <baz>') # alias
#

  #   - CGI.new(options_hash = {}) { block }
  # -->
  # Create a new CGI instance.
  #
  # `tag_maker`
  # :   This is the same as using the `options_hash` form with the value `{
  #     :tag_maker => tag_maker }` Note that it is recommended to use the
  #     `options_hash` form, since it also allows you specify the charset you will
  #     accept.
  # `options_hash`
  # :   A Hash that recognizes three options:
  #
  #     `:accept_charset`
  # :       specifies encoding of received query string.  If omitted,
  #         `@@accept_charset` is used.  If the encoding is not valid, a
  #         CGI::InvalidEncoding will be raised.
  #
  #         Example. Suppose `@@accept_charset` is "UTF-8"
  #
  #         when not specified:
  #
  #             cgi=CGI.new      # @accept_charset # => "UTF-8"
  #
  #         when specified as "EUC-JP":
  #
  #             cgi=CGI.new(:accept_charset => "EUC-JP") # => "EUC-JP"
  #
  #     `:tag_maker`
  # :       String that specifies which version of the HTML generation methods to
  #         use.  If not specified, no HTML generation methods will be loaded.
  #
  #         The following values are supported:
  #
  #         "html3"
  # :           HTML 3.x
  #         "html4"
  # :           HTML 4.0
  #         "html4Tr"
  # :           HTML 4.0 Transitional
  #         "html4Fr"
  # :           HTML 4.0 with Framesets
  #         "html5"
  # :           HTML 5
  #
  #
  #     `:max_multipart_length`
  # :       Specifies maximum length of multipart data. Can be an Integer scalar
  #         or a lambda, that will be evaluated when the request is parsed. This
  #         allows more complex logic to be set when determining whether to accept
  #         multipart data (e.g. consult a registered users upload allowance)
  #
  #         Default is 128 * 1024 * 1024 bytes
  #
  #             cgi=CGI.new(:max_multipart_length => 268435456) # simple scalar
  #
  #             cgi=CGI.new(:max_multipart_length => -> {check_filesystem}) # lambda
  #
  #
  # `block`
  # :   If provided, the block is called when an invalid encoding is encountered.
  #     For example:
  #
  #         encoding_errors={}
  #         cgi=CGI.new(:accept_charset=>"EUC-JP") do |name,value|
  #           encoding_errors[name] = value
  #         end
  #
  #
  # Finally, if the CGI object is not created in a standard CGI call environment
  # (that is, it can't locate REQUEST_METHOD in its environment), then it will run
  # in "offline" mode.  In this mode, it reads its parameters from the command
  # line or (failing that) from standard input.  Otherwise, cookies and other
  # parameters are parsed automatically from the standard CGI locations, which
  # varies according to the REQUEST_METHOD.
