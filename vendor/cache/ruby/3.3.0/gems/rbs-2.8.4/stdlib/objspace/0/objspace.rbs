# The objspace library extends the ObjectSpace module and adds several methods
# to get internal statistic information about object/memory management.
#
# You need to `require 'objspace'` to use this extension module.
#
# Generally, you *SHOULD NOT* use this library if you do not know about the MRI
# implementation.  Mainly, this library is for (memory) profiler developers and
# MRI developers who need to know about MRI memory usage.
