  # Numeric time zones that include minutes, such as `-10:00` or `+1330` will
  # work, as will simpler hour-only time zones like `-10` or `+13`.

  #
  # If the time zone does not match any of the above, `zone_offset` will check if

  # change the year used to find the local time zone.

  # If a block is given, the year described in `date` is converted by the block.
  # This is specifically designed for handling two digit years. For example, if
  # you wanted to treat all two digit years prior to 70 as the year 2000+ you
  # could write this:
  #
  #     require 'time'
  #
  #     Time.parse("01-10-31") {|year| year + (year < 70 ? 2000 : 1900)}
  #     #=> 2001-10-31 00:00:00 -0500
  #     Time.parse("70-10-31") {|year| year + (year < 70 ? 2000 : 1900)}
  #     #=> 1970-10-31 00:00:00 -0500
  #
  # If the upper components of the given time are broken or missing, they are
  # supplied with those of `now`.  For the lower components, the minimum values (1
  # or 0) are assumed if broken or missing.  For example:
  #
  #     require 'time'
  #
  #     # Suppose it is "Thu Nov 29 14:33:20 2001" now and
  #     # your time zone is EST which is GMT-5.
  #     now = Time.parse("Thu Nov 29 14:33:20 2001")
  #     Time.parse("16:30", now)     #=> 2001-11-29 16:30:00 -0500
  #     Time.parse("7/23", now)      #=> 2001-07-23 00:00:00 -0500
  #     Time.parse("Aug 31", now)    #=> 2001-08-31 00:00:00 -0500
  #     Time.parse("Aug 2000", now)  #=> 2000-08-01 00:00:00 -0500
  #
  # Since there are numerous conflicts among locally defined time zone
  # abbreviations all over the world, this method is not intended to understand
  # all of them.  For example, the abbreviation "CST" is used variously as:
  #
  #     -06:00 in America/Chicago,
  #     -05:00 in America/Havana,
  #     +08:00 in Asia/Harbin,
  #     +09:30 in Australia/Darwin,
  #     +10:30 in Australia/Adelaide,
  #     etc.
  #
  # Based on this fact, this method only understands the time zone abbreviations
  # described in RFC 822 and the system time zone, in the order named. (i.e. a
  # definition in RFC 822 overrides the system time zone definition.)  The system
  # time zone is taken from `Time.local(year, 1, 1).zone` and `Time.local(year, 7,
  # 1).zone`. If the extracted time zone abbreviation does not match any of them,
  # it is ignored and the given time is regarded as a local time.
  #
  # ArgumentError is raised if Date._parse cannot extract information from `date`
  # or if the Time class cannot represent specified date.
  #
  # This method can be used as a fail-safe for other parsing methods as:
  #
  #     Time.rfc2822(date) rescue Time.parse(date)
  #     Time.httpdate(date) rescue Time.parse(date)
  #     Time.xmlschema(date) rescue Time.parse(date)
  #
  # A failure of Time.parse should be checked, though.
  #
  # You must require 'time' to use this method.
