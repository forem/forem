# ## Manipulates strings like the UNIX Bourne shell
#
# This module manipulates strings according to the word parsing rules of the
# UNIX Bourne shell.
#
# The shellwords() function was originally a port of shellwords.pl, but modified
# to conform to the Shell & Utilities volume of the IEEE Std 1003.1-2008, 2016
# Edition [1].
#
# ### Usage
#
# You can use Shellwords to parse a string into a Bourne shell friendly Array.
#
#     require 'shellwords'
#
#     argv = Shellwords.split('three blind "mice"')
#     argv #=> ["three", "blind", "mice"]
#
# Once you've required Shellwords, you can use the #split alias
# String#shellsplit.
#
#     argv = "see how they run".shellsplit
#     argv #=> ["see", "how", "they", "run"]
#
# They treat quotes as special characters, so an unmatched quote will cause an
# ArgumentError.
#
#     argv = "they all ran after the farmer's wife".shellsplit
#          #=> ArgumentError: Unmatched quote: ...
#
# Shellwords also provides methods that do the opposite. Shellwords.escape, or
# its alias, String#shellescape, escapes shell metacharacters in a string for
# use in a command line.
#
#     filename = "special's.txt"
#
#     system("cat -- #{filename.shellescape}")
#     # runs "cat -- special\\'s.txt"
#
# Note the '--'.  Without it, cat(1) will treat the following argument as a
# command line option if it starts with '-'.  It is guaranteed that
# Shellwords.escape converts a string to a form that a Bourne shell will parse
# back to the original string, but it is the programmer's responsibility to make
# sure that passing an arbitrary argument to a command does no harm.
#
# Shellwords also comes with a core extension for Array, Array#shelljoin.
#
#     dir = "Funny GIFs"
#     argv = %W[ls -lta -- #{dir}]
#     system(argv.shelljoin + " | less")
#     # runs "ls -lta -- Funny\\ GIFs | less"
#
# You can use this method to build a complete command line out of an array of
# arguments.

  #   - shellescape(str)
  # -->
  # Escapes a string so that it can be safely used in a Bourne shell command line.
  #  `str` can be a non-string object that responds to `to_s`.
  #
  # Note that a resulted string should be used unquoted and is not intended for
  # use in double quotes nor in single quotes.
  #
  #     argv = Shellwords.escape("It's better to give than to receive")
  #     argv #=> "It\\'s\\ better\\ to\\ give\\ than\\ to\\ receive"
  #
  # String#shellescape is a shorthand for this function.
  #
  #     argv = "It's better to give than to receive".shellescape
  #     argv #=> "It\\'s\\ better\\ to\\ give\\ than\\ to\\ receive"

  #       }
  #     }
  #
  # It is the caller's responsibility to encode the string in the right encoding
  # for the shell environment where this string is used.
  #
  # Multibyte characters are treated as multibyte characters, not as bytes.
  #
  # Returns an empty quoted String if `str` has a length of zero.
