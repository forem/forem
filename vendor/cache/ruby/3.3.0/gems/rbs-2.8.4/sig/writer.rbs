    # ```ruby
    # put_lines(<<TEXT, leading_spaces: 0)
    # Hello
    #   world!
    # TEXT
    #
    # # Outputs
    # # Hello
    # #   world!
    #
    # put_lines(<<TEXT, leading_spaces: 2)
    # Hello
    #   world!
    # TEXT
    #
    # # Outputs
    # # Hello
    # # world!
    # ```
    #
    # This is for `Location#source`.
    # The `#source` returns the text spans from the beginning to end of the element.
    # It will look like the following.
    #
    # ```rbs
    # module Foo
    #   type t = Integer     # the definition of `t` starts from line=2, column=2
    #          | String
    #          | :false      # the definition of `t` ends from line=4, column=17
    # end
    # ```
    #
    # The expected output will be something like:
    #
    # ```rbs
    # type t = Integer       # Extracted from `Foo` definition and keeps the line breaks
    #        | String
    #        | :false
    # ```
    #
    # And it can be done with a `#put_lines(source, leading_spaces: 2)` call.
