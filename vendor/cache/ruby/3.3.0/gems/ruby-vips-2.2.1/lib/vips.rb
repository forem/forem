# Platform notes:
# linux:
#   Some distros allow "libvips.so", but only if the -dev headers have been
#   installed. To work everywhere, you must include the ABI number.
#   Confusingly, the file extension is not at the end. ffi adds the "lib"
#   prefix.
# mac:
#   As linux, but the extension is at the end and is added by ffi.
# windows:
#   The ABI number must be included, but with a hyphen. ffi does not add a
#   "lib" prefix or a ".dll" suffix.

# This module provides a binding for the [libvips image processing
# library](https://libvips.github.io/libvips/).
#
# # Example
#
# ```ruby
# require 'vips'
#
# if ARGV.length < 2
#     raise "usage: #{$PROGRAM_NAME}: input-file output-file"
# end
#
# im = Vips::Image.new_from_file ARGV[0], access: :sequential
#
# im *= [1, 2, 1]
#
# mask = Vips::Image.new_from_array [
#         [-1, -1, -1],
#         [-1, 16, -1],
#         [-1, -1, -1]
#        ], 8
# im = im.conv mask, precision: :integer
#
# im.write_to_file ARGV[1]
# ```
#
# This example loads a file, boosts the green channel (I'm not sure why),
# sharpens the image, and saves it back to disc again.
#
# Reading this example line by line, we have:
#
# ```ruby
# im = Vips::Image.new_from_file ARGV[0], access: :sequential
# ```
#
# {Image.new_from_file} can load any image file supported by vips. In this
# example, we will be accessing pixels top-to-bottom as we sweep through the
# image reading and writing, so `:sequential` access mode is best for us. The
# default mode is `:random`: this allows for full random access to image pixels,
# but is slower and needs more memory. See {Access}
# for full details
# on the various modes available.
#
# You can also load formatted images from memory buffers, create images that
# wrap C-style memory arrays, or make images from constants. Use {Source}
# and {Image.new_from_source} to load images from any data source, for
# example URIs.
#
# The next line:
#
# ```ruby
# im *= [1, 2, 1]
# ```
#
# Multiplying the image by an array constant uses one array element for each
# image band. This line assumes that the input image has three bands and will
# double the middle band. For RGB images, that's doubling green.
#
# Next we have:
#
# ```ruby
# mask = Vips::Image.new_from_array [
#         [-1, -1, -1],
#         [-1, 16, -1],
#         [-1, -1, -1]
#        ], 8
# im = im.conv mask, precision: :integer
# ```
#
# {Image.new_from_array} creates an image from an array constant. The 8 at
# the end sets the scale: the amount to divide the image by after
# integer convolution.
#
# See the libvips API docs for `vips_conv()` (the operation
# invoked by {Image#conv}) for details on the convolution operator. By default,
# it computes with a float mask, but `:integer` is fine for this case, and is
# much faster.
#
# Finally:
#
# ```ruby
# im.write_to_file ARGV[1]
# ```
#
# {Image#write_to_file} writes an image back to the filesystem. It can
# write any format supported by vips: the file type is set from the filename
# suffix. You can also write formatted images to memory buffers, or dump
# image data to a raw memory array.
#
# Use {Target} and {Image#write_to_target} to write formatted images to
# any data sink, for example URIs.
#
# # How it works
#
# The binding uses [ruby-ffi](https://github.com/ffi/ffi) to open the libvips
# shared library. When you call a method on the image class, it uses libvips
# introspection system (based on GObject) to search the
# library for an operation of that name, transforms the arguments to a form
# libvips can digest, and runs the operation.
#
# This means ruby-vips always presents the API implemented by the libvips shared
# library. It should update itself as new features are added.
#
# # Automatic wrapping
#
# `ruby-vips` adds a {Image.method_missing} handler to {Image} and uses
# it to look up vips operations. For example, the libvips operation `add`, which
# appears in C as `vips_add()`, appears in Ruby as {Image#add}.
#
# The operation's list of required arguments is searched and the first input
# image is set to the value of `self`. Operations which do not take an input
# image, such as {Image.black}, appear as class methods. The remainder of
# the arguments you supply in the function call are used to set the other
# required input arguments. Any trailing keyword arguments are used to set
# options on the operation.
#
# The result is the required output
# argument if there is only one result, or an array of values if the operation
# produces several results. If the operation has optional output objects, they
# are returned as a final hash.
#
# For example, {Image#min}, the vips operation that searches an image for
# the minimum value, has a large number of optional arguments. You can use it to
# find the minimum value like this:
#
# ```ruby
# min_value = image.min
# ```
#
# You can ask it to return the position of the minimum with `:x` and `:y`.
#
# ```ruby
# min_value, opts = min x: true, y: true
# x_pos = opts['x']
# y_pos = opts['y']
# ```
#
# Now `x_pos` and `y_pos` will have the coordinates of the minimum value.
# There's actually a convenience method for this, {Image#minpos}.
#
# You can also ask for the top *n* minimum, for example:
#
# ```ruby
# min_value, opts = min size: 10, x_array: true, y_array: true
# x_pos = opts['x_array']
# y_pos = opts['y_array']
# ```
#
# Now `x_pos` and `y_pos` will be 10-element arrays.
#
# Because operations are member functions and return the result image, you can
# chain them. For example, you can write:
#
# ```ruby
# result_image = image.real.cos
# ```
#
# to calculate the cosine of the real part of a complex image.
# There are also a full set
# of arithmetic operator overloads, see below.
#
# libvips types are also automatically wrapped. The override looks at the type
# of argument required by the operation and converts the value you supply,
# when it can. For example, {Image#linear} takes a `VipsArrayDouble` as
# an argument
# for the set of constants to use for multiplication. You can supply this
# value as an integer, a float, or some kind of compound object and it
# will be converted for you. You can write:
#
# ```ruby
# result_image = image.linear 1, 3
# result_image = image.linear 12.4, 13.9
# result_image = image.linear [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]
# result_image = image.linear 1, [4, 5, 6]
# ```
#
# And so on. A set of overloads are defined for {Image#linear}, see below.
#
# It does a couple of more ambitious conversions. It will automatically convert
# to and from the various vips types, like `VipsBlob` and `VipsArrayImage`. For
# example, you can read the ICC profile out of an image like this:
#
# ```ruby
# profile = im.get_value "icc-profile-data"
# ```
#
# and profile will be a byte array.
#
# If an operation takes several input images, you can use a constant for all but
# one of them and the wrapper will expand the constant to an image for you. For
# example, {Image#ifthenelse} uses a condition image to pick pixels
# between a then and an else image:
#
# ```ruby
# result_image = condition_image.ifthenelse then_image, else_image
# ```
#
# You can use a constant instead of either the then or the else parts and it
# will be expanded to an image for you. If you use a constant for both then and
# else, it will be expanded to match the condition image. For example:
#
# ```ruby
# result_image = condition_image.ifthenelse [0, 255, 0], [255, 0, 0]
# ```
#
# Will make an image where true pixels are green and false pixels are red.
#
# This is useful for {Image#bandjoin}, the thing to join two or more
# images up bandwise. You can write:
#
# ```ruby
# rgba = rgb.bandjoin 255
# ```
#
# to append a constant 255 band to an image, perhaps to add an alpha channel. Of
# course you can also write:
#
# ```ruby
# result_image = image1.bandjoin image2
# result_image = image1.bandjoin [image2, image3]
# result_image = Vips::Image.bandjoin [image1, image2, image3]
# result_image = image1.bandjoin [image2, 255]
# ```
#
# and so on.
#
# # Logging
#
# Libvips uses g_log() to log warning, debug, info and (some) error messages.
#
# https://developer.gnome.org/glib/stable/glib-Message-Logging.html
#
# You can disable warnings by defining the `VIPS_WARNING` environment variable.
# You can enable info output by defining `VIPS_INFO`.
#
# # Exceptions
#
# The wrapper spots errors from vips operations and raises the {Vips::Error}
# exception. You can catch it in the usual way.
#
# # Automatic YARD documentation
#
# The bulk of these API docs are generated automatically by {Yard#generate}.
# It examines libvips and writes a summary of each operation and the arguments
# and options that that operation expects.
#
# Use the [C API # docs](https://libvips.github.io/libvips/API/current)
# for more detail.
#
# # Enums
#
# The libvips enums, such as `VipsBandFormat` appear in ruby-vips as Symbols
# like `:uchar`. They are documented as a set of classes for convenience, see
# {Vips::BandFormat}, for example.
#
# # Draw operations
#
# There are two ways of calling the libvips draw operations, like
# {Image#draw_circle} and {Image#draw_line}.
#
# First, you can use them like functions. For example:
#
# ```ruby
# y = x.draw_line 255, 0, 0, x.width, x.height
# ```
#
# This will make a new image, `y`, which is a copy of `x` but with a line
# drawn across it. `x` is unchanged.
#
# This is simple, but will be slow if you want to draw many lines, since
# ruby-vips will make a copy of the whole image each time.
#
# You can use {Image#mutate} to make a {MutableImage}. This is an image which
# is unshared and is only available inside the {Image#mutate} block. Within
# this block, you can use `!` versions of the draw operations to modify images
# and avoid the copy. For example:
#
# ```ruby
# image = image.mutate do |mutable|
#   (0 ... 1).step(0.01) do |i|
#     mutable.draw_line! 255, mutable.width * i, 0, 0, mutable.height * (1 - i)
#   end
# end
# ```
#
# Now each {Image#draw_line} will directly modify the mutable image, saving
# the copy. This is much faster and needs much less memory.
#
# # Metadata read
#
# Use {Image#get_fields} to get a list of the metadata fields that an image
# supports. ICC profiles, for example, are in a field called
# `icc-profile-data`. Use `vipsheader -a something.jpg` at the command-line
# to see all the fields on an image.
#
# Use {Image#get_typeof} to get the type of a field. Types are integers, with
# 0 meaning "no such field". Constants like {GObject::GINT_TYPE} are useful for
# testing field types.
#
# You can read image metadata using {Image#get}. The field value is converted
# to a Ruby value in the obvious way.
#
# # Metadata write
#
# You can also set and remove image metadata fields. Images are immutable, so
# you must make any changes inside a {Image#mutate} block. For example:
#
# ```ruby
# image = image.mutate do |mutable|
#   image.get_fields.each do |field|
#     mutable.remove! field unless field == "icc-profile-data"
#   end
# end
# ```
#
# To remove all metadata except the icc profile.
#
# You can use {MutableImage#set!} to change the value of an existing field,
# and {MutableImage#set_type!} to create a new field with a specified type.
#
# # Progress
#
# You can attach signal handlers to images to watch computation progress. For
# example:
#
# ```ruby
# image = Vips::Image.black 1, 100000
# image.set_progress true
#
# def progress_to_s(name, progress)
#   puts "#{name}:"
#   puts "    run = #{progress[:run]}"
#   puts "    eta = #{progress[:eta]}"
#   puts "    tpels = #{progress[:tpels]}"
#   puts "    npels = #{progress[:npels]}"
#   puts "    percent = #{progress[:percent]}"
# end
#
# image.signal_connect :preeval do |progress|
#   progress_to_s("preeval", progress)
# end
#
# image.signal_connect :eval do |progress|
#   progress_to_s("eval", progress)
#   image.set_kill(true) if progress[:percent] > 50
# end
#
# image.signal_connect :posteval do |progress|
#   progress_to_s("posteval", progress)
# end
#
# image.avg
# ```
#
# The `:eval` signal will fire for every tile that is processed. You can stop
# progress with {Image#set_kill} and processing will end with an exception.
#
# User streams
#
# You can make your own input and output stream objects with {SourceCustom} and
# {TargetCustom}. For example:
#
# ```ruby
# file = File.open "some/file", "rb"
# source = Vips::SourceCustom.new
# source.on_read { |length| file.read length }
# image = Vips::Image.new_from_source source, "", access: "sequential"
# ```
#
# # Overloads
#
# The wrapper defines the usual set of arithmetic, boolean and relational
# overloads on image. You can mix images, constants and lists of constants
# (almost) freely. For example, you can write:
#
# ```ruby
# result_image = ((image * [1, 2, 3]).abs < 128) | 4
# ```
#
# # Expansions
#
# Some vips operators take an enum to select an action, for example
# {Image#math} can be used to calculate sine of every pixel like this:
#
# ```ruby
# result_image = image.math :sin
# ```
#
# This is annoying, so the wrapper expands all these enums into separate members
# named after the enum. So you can write:
#
# ```ruby
# result_image = image.sin
# ```
#
# # Convenience functions
#
# The wrapper defines a few extra useful utility functions:
# {Image#get_value}, {Image#set_value}, {Image#bandsplit},
# {Image#maxpos}, {Image#minpos},
# {Image#median}.
