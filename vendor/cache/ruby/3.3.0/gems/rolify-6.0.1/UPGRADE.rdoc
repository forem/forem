= Upgrade instructions for Rolify library

== From a previous rolify installation (1.x or 2.x)

The easiest way is to re-run the generator using <tt>rails g Rolify:Role</tt> command, and overwrite the initializer file. Both the migration file and the <tt>role.rb</tt> haven't changed.
In the <tt>config/initializers/rolify.rb</tt> file, here are the deprecated settings:
* <tt>role_cname</tt>
* <tt>user_cname</tt>
By default, these settings were commented out, so you can safely remove them. 
If you changed them, you can remove them in the initializer file too. <tt>user_cname</tt> is no longer used in 3.x, you don't need it anymore.
Add your custom <tt>role_cname</tt> setting as argument of the rolify method you use in your User class. 
For instance, if you use <tt>Privilege</tt> as <tt>Role</tt> class, you should add this to your whatever your <tt>User</tt> class is, let's say <tt>Client</tt> for the sake of example: 
   class Client < ActiveRecord::Base
     rolify :role_cname => "Privilege"
   end
If you use the default <tt>Role</tt> class name, you don't have to specify the <tt>:role_cname</tt> argument.

If you use <i>dynamic methods</i> (<tt>user.is_admin?</tt> like methods), you should turn it on using <tt>use_dynamic_shortcuts</tt> method starting from rolify 3.0:
   Rolify.configure do |c|
      c.use_dynamic_shortcuts
   end
The old fashion way still works though, but won't work anymore if the setter method name is changed in a possible future. You've been warned :-)

== From a rolify installation 3.x

=== Dependencies: 

Starting from 3.3 release, rolify supports Rails 3.2 and newer.

Mongoid callbacks are supported if Mongoid 3.1 and newer is installed.

=== Rails Generators

Role model template when using Mongoid has been changed, you should re-run the generator.

Rails generator has been renamed to: <tt>rails g rolify</tt> and arguments have been changed: 
* Role class name is now mandatory, User class name remains optional and its default is still <tt>User</tt>
* ORM optional argument is now <tt>-o</tt> or <tt>--orm=</tt>
For instance, here is a new rolify generator command example: <tt>rails g rolify Role</tt>
You can use <tt>rails g rolify --help</tt> to see all available options.

=== Testing

Starting from rolify 3.3, to run the specs you should run: <tt>rake spec</tt> or simply <tt>rake</tt>.
