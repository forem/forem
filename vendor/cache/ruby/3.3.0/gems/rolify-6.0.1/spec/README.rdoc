= Rolify Specs

== Running the specs

To run the specs first run the +bundle+ command to install the necessary gems and the +rake+ command to run the specs.

  bundle
  rake

== Model Adapters

Rolify currently supports 2 different ORMs: ActiveRecord and Mongoid. By default it will use Active Record but you can change this by setting the +ADAPTER+ environment variable before running the specs. You can run the +bundle+ command with this as well to ensure you have all the required gems.

  ADAPTER=mongoid bundle
  ADAPTER=mongoid rake

The different model adapters you can specify are:

* active_record (default)
* mongoid

You can also run the +spec_all+ rake task to run specs for each adapter.

  rake spec_all
