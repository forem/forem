  # Net::IMAP implements Internet Message Access Protocol (\IMAP) client
  # functionality.  The protocol is described
  # in {IMAP4rev1 [RFC3501]}[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3501]
  # and {IMAP4rev2 [RFC9051]}[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc9051].
  #
  # == \IMAP Overview
  #
  # An \IMAP client connects to a server, and then authenticates
  # itself using either #authenticate or #login.  Having
  # authenticated itself, there is a range of commands
  # available to it.  Most work with mailboxes, which may be
  # arranged in an hierarchical namespace, and each of which
  # contains zero or more messages.  How this is implemented on
  # the server is implementation-dependent; on a UNIX server, it
  # will frequently be implemented as files in mailbox format
  # within a hierarchy of directories.
  #
  # To work on the messages within a mailbox, the client must
  # first select that mailbox, using either #select or #examine
  # (for read-only access).  Once the client has successfully
  # selected a mailbox, they enter the "_selected_" state, and that
  # mailbox becomes the _current_ mailbox, on which mail-item
  # related commands implicitly operate.
  #
  # === Sequence numbers and UIDs
  #
  # Messages have two sorts of identifiers: message sequence
  # numbers and UIDs.
  #
  # Message sequence numbers number messages within a mailbox
  # from 1 up to the number of items in the mailbox.  If a new
  # message arrives during a session, it receives a sequence
  # number equal to the new size of the mailbox.  If messages
  # are expunged from the mailbox, remaining messages have their
  # sequence numbers "shuffled down" to fill the gaps.
  #
  # To avoid sequence number race conditions, servers must not expunge messages
  # when no command is in progress, nor when responding to #fetch, #store, or
  # #search.  Expunges _may_ be sent during any other command, including
  # #uid_fetch, #uid_store, and #uid_search.  The #noop and #idle commands are
  # both useful for this side-effect: they allow the server to send all mailbox
  # updates, including expunges.
  #
  # UIDs, on the other hand, are permanently guaranteed not to
  # identify another message within the same mailbox, even if
  # the existing message is deleted.  UIDs are required to
  # be assigned in ascending (but not necessarily sequential)
  # order within a mailbox; this means that if a non-IMAP client
  # rearranges the order of mail items within a mailbox, the
  # UIDs have to be reassigned.  An \IMAP client thus cannot
  # rearrange message orders.
  #
  # === Examples of Usage
  #
  # ==== List sender and subject of all recent messages in the default mailbox
  #
  #   imap = Net::IMAP.new('mail.example.com')
  #   imap.authenticate('PLAIN', 'joe_user', 'joes_password')
  #   imap.examine('INBOX')
  #   imap.search(["RECENT"]).each do |message_id|
  #     envelope = imap.fetch(message_id, "ENVELOPE")[0].attr["ENVELOPE"]
  #     puts "#{envelope.from[0].name}: \t#{envelope.subject}"
  #   end
  #
  # ==== Move all messages from April 2003 from "Mail/sent-mail" to "Mail/sent-apr03"
  #
  #   imap = Net::IMAP.new('mail.example.com')
  #   imap.authenticate('PLAIN', 'joe_user', 'joes_password')
  #   imap.select('Mail/sent-mail')
  #   if not imap.list('Mail/', 'sent-apr03')
  #     imap.create('Mail/sent-apr03')
  #   end
  #   imap.search(["BEFORE", "30-Apr-2003", "SINCE", "1-Apr-2003"]).each do |message_id|
  #     imap.copy(message_id, "Mail/sent-apr03")
  #     imap.store(message_id, "+FLAGS", [:Deleted])
  #   end
  #   imap.expunge
  #
  # == Capabilities
  #
  # Most Net::IMAP methods do not _currently_ modify their behaviour according
  # to the server's advertised #capabilities.  Users of this class must check
  # that the server is capable of extension commands or command arguments before
  # sending them.  Special care should be taken to follow the #capabilities
  # requirements for #starttls, #login, and #authenticate.
  #
  # See #capable?, #auth_capable?, #capabilities, #auth_mechanisms to discover
  # server capabilities.  For relevant capability requirements, see the
  # documentation on each \IMAP command.
  #
  #   imap = Net::IMAP.new("mail.example.com")
  #   imap.capable?(:IMAP4rev1) or raise "Not an IMAP4rev1 server"
  #   imap.capable?(:starttls)  or raise "Cannot start TLS"
  #   imap.starttls
  #
  #   if imap.auth_capable?("PLAIN")
  #     imap.authenticate "PLAIN", username, password
  #   elsif !imap.capability?("LOGINDISABLED")
  #     imap.login username, password
  #   else
  #     raise "No acceptable authentication mechanisms"
  #   end
  #
  #   # Support for "UTF8=ACCEPT" implies support for "ENABLE"
  #   imap.enable :utf8 if imap.capable?("UTF8=ACCEPT")
  #
  #   namespaces  = imap.namespace if imap.capable?(:namespace)
  #   mbox_prefix = namespaces&.personal&.first&.prefix || ""
  #   mbox_delim  = namespaces&.personal&.first&.delim  || "/"
  #   mbox_path   = prefix + %w[path to my mailbox].join(delim)
  #   imap.create mbox_path
  #
  # === Basic IMAP4rev1 capabilities
  #
  # IMAP4rev1 servers must advertise +IMAP4rev1+ in their capabilities list.
  # IMAP4rev1 servers must _implement_ the +STARTTLS+, <tt>AUTH=PLAIN</tt>,
  # and +LOGINDISABLED+ capabilities.  See #starttls, #login, and #authenticate
  # for the implications of these capabilities.
  #
  # === Caching +CAPABILITY+ responses
  #
  # Net::IMAP automatically stores and discards capability data according to the
  # the requirements and recommendations in
  # {IMAP4rev2 §6.1.1}[https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9051#section-6.1.1],
  # {§6.2}[https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9051#section-6.2], and
  # {§7.1}[https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9051#section-7.1].
  # Use #capable?, #auth_capable?, or #capabilities to use this cache and avoid
  # sending the #capability command unnecessarily.
  #
  # The server may advertise its initial capabilities using the +CAPABILITY+
  # ResponseCode in a +PREAUTH+ or +OK+ #greeting.  When TLS has started
  # (#starttls) and after authentication (#login or #authenticate), the server's
  # capabilities may change and cached capabilities are discarded.  The server
  # may send updated capabilities with an +OK+ TaggedResponse to #login or
  # #authenticate, and these will be cached by Net::IMAP.  But the
  # TaggedResponse to #starttls MUST be ignored--it is sent before TLS starts
  # and is unprotected.
  #
  # When storing capability values to variables, be careful that they are
  # discarded or reset appropriately, especially following #starttls.
  #
  # === Using IMAP4rev1 extensions
  #
  # See the {IANA IMAP4 capabilities
  # registry}[http://www.iana.org/assignments/imap4-capabilities] for a list of
  # all standard capabilities, and their reference RFCs.
  #
  # IMAP4rev1 servers must not activate behavior that is incompatible with the
  # base specification until an explicit client action invokes a capability,
  # e.g. sending a command or command argument specific to that capability.
  # Servers may send data with backward compatible behavior, such as response
  # codes or mailbox attributes, at any time without client action.
  #
  # Invoking capabilities which are unknown to Net::IMAP may cause unexpected
  # behavior and errors.  For example, ResponseParseError is raised when
  # unknown response syntax is received.  Invoking commands or command
  # parameters that are unsupported by the server may raise NoResponseError,
  # BadResponseError, or cause other unexpected behavior.
  #
  # Some capabilities must be explicitly activated using the #enable command.
  # See #enable for details.
  #
  # == Thread Safety
  #
  # Net::IMAP supports concurrent threads. For example,
  #
  #   imap = Net::IMAP.new("imap.foo.net", "imap2")
  #   imap.authenticate("scram-md5", "bar", "password")
  #   imap.select("inbox")
  #   fetch_thread = Thread.start { imap.fetch(1..-1, "UID") }
  #   search_result = imap.search(["BODY", "hello"])
  #   fetch_result = fetch_thread.value
  #   imap.disconnect
  #
  # This script invokes the FETCH command and the SEARCH command concurrently.
  #
  # == Errors
  #
  # An \IMAP server can send three different types of responses to indicate
  # failure:
  #
  # NO:: the attempted command could not be successfully completed.  For
  #      instance, the username/password used for logging in are incorrect;
  #      the selected mailbox does not exist; etc.
  #
  # BAD:: the request from the client does not follow the server's
  #       understanding of the \IMAP protocol.  This includes attempting
  #       commands from the wrong client state; for instance, attempting
  #       to perform a SEARCH command without having SELECTed a current
  #       mailbox.  It can also signal an internal server
  #       failure (such as a disk crash) has occurred.
  #
  # BYE:: the server is saying goodbye.  This can be part of a normal
  #       logout sequence, and can be used as part of a login sequence
  #       to indicate that the server is (for some reason) unwilling
  #       to accept your connection.  As a response to any other command,
  #       it indicates either that the server is shutting down, or that
  #       the server is timing out the client connection due to inactivity.
  #
  # These three error response are represented by the errors
  # Net::IMAP::NoResponseError, Net::IMAP::BadResponseError, and
  # Net::IMAP::ByeResponseError, all of which are subclasses of
  # Net::IMAP::ResponseError.  Essentially, all methods that involve
  # sending a request to the server can generate one of these errors.
  # Only the most pertinent instances have been documented below.
  #
  # Because the IMAP class uses Sockets for communication, its methods
  # are also susceptible to the various errors that can occur when
  # working with sockets.  These are generally represented as
  # Errno errors.  For instance, any method that involves sending a
  # request to the server and/or receiving a response from it could
  # raise an Errno::EPIPE error if the network connection unexpectedly
  # goes down.  See the socket(7), ip(7), tcp(7), socket(2), connect(2),
  # and associated man pages.
  #
  # Finally, a Net::IMAP::DataFormatError is thrown if low-level data
  # is found to be in an incorrect format (for instance, when converting
  # between UTF-8 and UTF-16), and Net::IMAP::ResponseParseError is
  # thrown if a server response is non-parseable.

  # === Connection control methods
  #
  # - Net::IMAP.new: Creates a new \IMAP client which connects immediately and
  #   waits for a successful server greeting before the method returns.
  # - #starttls: Asks the server to upgrade a clear-text connection to use TLS.
  # - #logout: Tells the server to end the session. Enters the "_logout_" state.
  # - #disconnect: Disconnects the connection (without sending #logout first).
  # - #disconnected?: True if the connection has been closed.
  #
  # === Server capabilities
  #
  # - #capable?: Returns whether the server supports a given capability.
  # - #capabilities: Returns the server's capabilities as an array of strings.

  #   SASL mechanism, for use with #authenticate.
  # - #auth_mechanisms: Returns the #authenticate SASL mechanisms which
  #   the server claims to support as an array of strings.
  # - #clear_cached_capabilities: Clears cached capabilities.
  #
  #   <em>The capabilities cache is automatically cleared after completing
  #   #starttls, #login, or #authenticate.</em>
  # - #capability: Sends the +CAPABILITY+ command and returns the #capabilities.
  #
  #   <em>In general, #capable? should be used rather than explicitly sending a
  #   +CAPABILITY+ command to the server.</em>
  #
  # === Handling server responses
  #
  # - #greeting: The server's initial untagged response, which can indicate a
  #   pre-authenticated connection.
  # - #responses: Yields unhandled UntaggedResponse#data and <em>non-+nil+</em>
  #   ResponseCode#data.
  # - #extract_responses: Removes and returns the responses for which the block
  #   returns a true value.
  # - #clear_responses: Deletes unhandled data from #responses and returns it.
  # - #add_response_handler: Add a block to be called inside the receiver thread
  #   with every server response.
  # - #response_handlers: Returns the list of response handlers.
  # - #remove_response_handler: Remove a previously added response handler.
  #
  # === Core \IMAP commands
  #
  # The following commands are defined either by
  # the [IMAP4rev1[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3501]] base specification, or
  # by one of the following extensions:
  # [IDLE[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2177]],
  # [NAMESPACE[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2342]],
  # [UNSELECT[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3691]],
  # [ENABLE[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5161]],
  # [MOVE[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6851]].
  # These extensions are widely supported by modern IMAP4rev1 servers and have
  # all been integrated into [IMAP4rev2[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc9051]].
  # <em>*NOTE:* Net::IMAP doesn't support IMAP4rev2 yet.</em>
  #
  # ==== Any state
  #
  # - #capability: Returns the server's capabilities as an array of strings.
  #
  #   <em>In general, #capable? should be used rather than explicitly sending a
  #   +CAPABILITY+ command to the server.</em>
  # - #noop: Allows the server to send unsolicited untagged #responses.
  # - #logout: Tells the server to end the session. Enters the "_logout_" state.
  #
  # ==== Not Authenticated state
  #
  # In addition to the commands for any state, the following commands are valid
  # in the "<em>not authenticated</em>" state:

  #
  #   <em>The server should list <tt>"AUTH=#{mechanism}"</tt> capabilities for
  #   supported mechanisms.</em>
  # - #login: Identifies the client to the server using a plain text password.
  #   Using #authenticate is generally preferred.  Enters the "_authenticated_"
  #   state.
  #
  #   <em>The +LOGINDISABLED+ capability</em> <b>must NOT</b> <em>be listed.</em>
  #
  # ==== Authenticated state
  #
  # In addition to the commands for any state, the following commands are valid
  # in the "_authenticated_" state:
  #
  # - #enable: Enables backwards incompatible server extensions.

  #   count, +UIDVALIDITY+ and +UIDNEXT+.
  # - #append: Appends a message to the end of a mailbox.
  # - #idle: Allows the server to send updates to the client, without the client
  #   needing to poll using #noop.
  #   <em>Requires the +IDLE+ or +IMAP4rev2+ capability.</em>
  # - *Obsolete* #lsub: <em>Replaced by <tt>LIST-EXTENDED</tt> and removed from
  #   +IMAP4rev2+.</em>  Lists mailboxes in the "subscribed" set.
  #
  #   <em>*Note:* Net::IMAP hasn't implemented <tt>LIST-EXTENDED</tt> yet.</em>
  #
  # ==== Selected state
  #
  # In addition to the commands for any state and the "_authenticated_"
  # commands, the following commands are valid in the "_selected_" state:
  #
  # - #close: Closes the mailbox and returns to the "_authenticated_" state,
  #   expunging deleted messages, unless the mailbox was opened as read-only.
  # - #unselect: Closes the mailbox and returns to the "_authenticated_" state,
  #   without expunging any messages.
  #   <em>Requires the +UNSELECT+ or +IMAP4rev2+ capability.</em>

  #   <em>Requires the +MOVE+ or +IMAP4rev2+ capability.</em>
  # - #check: <em>*Obsolete:* removed from +IMAP4rev2+.</em>
  #   Can be replaced with #noop or #idle.
  #
  # ==== Logout state
  #
  # No \IMAP commands are valid in the "_logout_" state.  If the socket is still
  # open, Net::IMAP will close it after receiving server confirmation.
  # Exceptions will be raised by \IMAP commands that have already started and
  # are waiting for a response, as well as any that are called after logout.

    #
    # [ssl]
    #   If +true+, the connection will use TLS with the default params set by
    #   {OpenSSL::SSL::SSLContext#set_params}[https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/OpenSSL/SSL/SSLContext.html#method-i-set_params].
    #   If +ssl+ is a hash, it's passed to
    #   {OpenSSL::SSL::SSLContext#set_params}[https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/OpenSSL/SSL/SSLContext.html#method-i-set_params];
    #   the keys are names of attribute assignment methods on
    #   SSLContext[https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/OpenSSL/SSL/SSLContext.html].  For example:
    #
    #   [{ca_file}[https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/OpenSSL/SSL/SSLContext.html#attribute-i-ca_file]]
    #     The path to a file containing a PEM-format CA certificate.
    #   [{ca_path}[https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/OpenSSL/SSL/SSLContext.html#attribute-i-ca_path]]
    #     The path to a directory containing CA certificates in PEM format.
    #   [{min_version}[https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/OpenSSL/SSL/SSLContext.html#method-i-min_version-3D]]
    #     Sets the lower bound on the supported SSL/TLS protocol version. Set to
    #     an +OpenSSL+ constant such as +OpenSSL::SSL::TLS1_2_VERSION+,
    #   [{verify_mode}[https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/OpenSSL/SSL/SSLContext.html#attribute-i-verify_mode]]
    #     SSL session verification mode.  Valid modes include
    #     +OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY_PEER+ and +OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY_NONE+.
    #
    #   See {OpenSSL::SSL::SSLContext}[https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/OpenSSL/SSL/SSLContext.html] for other valid SSL context params.
    #
    #   See DeprecatedClientOptions.new for deprecated SSL arguments.
    #
    # [config]
    #   A Net::IMAP::Config object to use as the basis for #config.  By default,
    #   the global Net::IMAP.config is used.
    #
    #   >>>
    #     *NOTE:* +config+ does not set #config directly---it sets the _parent_
    #     config for inheritance.  Every client creates its own unique #config.
    #
    #   All other keyword arguments are forwarded to Net::IMAP::Config.new, to
    #   initialize the client's #config. For example:
    #
    #   [{open_timeout}[rdoc-ref:Config#open_timeout]]
    #     Seconds to wait until a connection is opened
    #   [{idle_response_timeout}[rdoc-ref:Config#idle_response_timeout]]
    #     Seconds to wait until an IDLE response is received
    #
    #   See Net::IMAP::Config for other valid options.
    #
    # ==== Examples
    #
    # Connect to cleartext port 143 at mail.example.com and receive the server greeting:

    #   imap.greeting      => name: ("OK" | "PREAUTH") => status
    #   status # => "OK"
    #   # The client is connected in the "Not Authenticated" state.
    #
    # Connect with TLS to port 993
    #   imap = Net::IMAP.new('mail.example.com', ssl: true) # => #<Net::IMAP:0x00007f79b0872bd0>

    #     imap.authenticate("PLAIN", "joe_user", "joes_password")
    #   in /PREAUTH/i
    #     # The client is connected in the "Authenticated" state.
    #   end
    #
    # Connect with prior authentication, for example using an SSL certificate:

    #   }
    #   imap = Net::IMAP.new('mail.example.com', ssl: ssl_ctx_params)

    #
    # ==== Mechanisms
    #
    # Each mechanism has different properties and requirements.  Please consult
    # the documentation for the specific mechanisms you are using:
    #
    # +ANONYMOUS+::
    #     See AnonymousAuthenticator[rdoc-ref:Net::IMAP::SASL::AnonymousAuthenticator].
    #
    #     Allows the user to gain access to public services or resources without
    #     authenticating or disclosing an identity.
    #
    # +EXTERNAL+::
    #     See ExternalAuthenticator[rdoc-ref:Net::IMAP::SASL::ExternalAuthenticator].
    #
    #     Authenticates using already established credentials, such as a TLS
    #     certificate or IPsec.
    #
    # +OAUTHBEARER+::
    #     See OAuthBearerAuthenticator[rdoc-ref:Net::IMAP::SASL::OAuthBearerAuthenticator].
    #
    #     Login using an OAuth2 Bearer token.  This is the standard mechanism
    #     for using OAuth2 with \SASL, but it is not yet deployed as widely as
    #     +XOAUTH2+.
    #
    # +PLAIN+::
    #     See PlainAuthenticator[rdoc-ref:Net::IMAP::SASL::PlainAuthenticator].
    #
    #     Login using clear-text username and password.
    #
    # +SCRAM-SHA-1+::
    # +SCRAM-SHA-256+::
    #     See ScramAuthenticator[rdoc-ref:Net::IMAP::SASL::ScramAuthenticator].
    #
    #     Login by username and password.  The password is not sent to the
    #     server but is used in a salted challenge/response exchange.
    #     +SCRAM-SHA-1+ and +SCRAM-SHA-256+ are directly supported by
    #     Net::IMAP::SASL.  New authenticators can easily be added for any other
    #     <tt>SCRAM-*</tt> mechanism if the digest algorithm is supported by
    #     OpenSSL::Digest.
    #
    # +XOAUTH2+::
    #     See XOAuth2Authenticator[rdoc-ref:Net::IMAP::SASL::XOAuth2Authenticator].
    #
    #     Login using a username and an OAuth2 access token.  Non-standard and
    #     obsoleted by +OAUTHBEARER+, but widely supported.
    #
    # See the {SASL mechanism
    # registry}[https://www.iana.org/assignments/sasl-mechanisms/sasl-mechanisms.xhtml]
    # for a list of all SASL mechanisms and their specifications.  To register
    # new authenticators, see Authenticators.
    #
    # ===== Deprecated mechanisms
    #
    # <em>Obsolete mechanisms should be avoided, but are still available for
    # backwards compatibility.  See</em> Net::IMAP::SASL@Deprecated+mechanisms.
    # <em>Using a deprecated mechanism will print a warning.</em>
    #
    # ==== Capabilities
    #
    # <tt>"AUTH=#{mechanism}"</tt> capabilities indicate server support for
    # mechanisms.  Use #auth_capable? or #auth_mechanisms to check for support
    # before using a particular mechanism.

    # Although servers should list all supported \SASL mechanisms, they may
    # allow authentication with an unlisted +mechanism+.
    #
    # If [SASL-IR[https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4959.html]] is supported
    # and the appropriate <tt>"AUTH=#{mechanism}"</tt> capability is present,
    # an "initial response" may be sent as an argument to the +AUTHENTICATE+
    # command, saving a round-trip.  The SASL exchange allows for server
    # challenges and client responses, but many mechanisms expect the client to
    # "respond" first.  The initial response will only be sent for
    # "client-first" mechanisms.
    #
    # Server capabilities may change after #starttls, #login, and #authenticate.

    #    a certain mailbox, there can be circumstances where it is unclear which
    #    Personal Namespaces it should create the mailbox in.  In these

    # +ENABLE+ [RFC5161[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5161]]
    # or +IMAP4REV2+ [RFC9051[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc9051]].
    #
    # Additionally, the server capabilities must include a capability matching
    # each enabled extension (usually the same name as the enabled extension).
    # The following capabilities may be enabled:
    #
    # [+CONDSTORE+ {[RFC7162]}[https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7162.html]]
    #
    #   Updates various commands to return +CONDSTORE+ extension responses.  It
    #   is not necessary to explicitly enable +CONDSTORE+—using any of the
    #   command parameters defined by the extension will implicitly enable it.
    #   See {[RFC7162 §3.1]}[https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7162.html#section-3.1].
    #
    # [+:utf8+ --- an alias for <tt>"UTF8=ACCEPT"</tt>]
    #
    #   In a future release, <tt>enable(:utf8)</tt> will enable either
    #   <tt>"UTF8=ACCEPT"</tt> or <tt>"IMAP4rev2"</tt>, depending on server
    #   capabilities.
    #
    # [<tt>"UTF8=ACCEPT"</tt> [RFC6855[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6855]]]
    #
    #   The server's capabilities must include <tt>UTF8=ACCEPT</tt> _or_
    #   <tt>UTF8=ONLY</tt>.
    #
    #   This allows the server to send strings encoded as UTF-8 which might
    #   otherwise need to use a 7-bit encoding, such as {modified
    #   UTF-7}[::decode_utf7] for mailbox names, or RFC2047 encoded-words for
    #   message headers.
    #
    #   *Note:* <em>A future update may set string encodings slightly
    #   differently</em>, e.g: "US-ASCII" when UTF-8 is not enabled, and "UTF-8"
    #   when it is.  Currently, the encoding of strings sent as "quoted" or
    #   "text" will _always_ be "UTF-8", even when only ASCII characters are
    #   used (e.g. "Subject: Agenda") And currently, string "literals" sent
    #   by the server will always have an "ASCII-8BIT" (binary)
    #   encoding, even if they generally contain UTF-8 data, if they are
    #   text at all.
    #
    # [<tt>"UTF8=ONLY"</tt> [RFC6855[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6855]]]
    #
    #   A server that reports the <tt>UTF8=ONLY</tt> capability _requires_ that
    #   the client <tt>enable("UTF8=ACCEPT")</tt> before any mailboxes may be
    #   selected.  For convenience, <tt>enable("UTF8=ONLY")</tt> is aliased to
    #   <tt>enable("UTF8=ACCEPT")</tt>.
    #
    # ===== Unsupported capabilities
    #
    # *Note:* Some extensions that use ENABLE permit the server to send syntax
    # that Net::IMAP cannot parse, which may raise an exception and disconnect.
    # Some extensions may work, but the support may be incomplete, untested, or
    # experimental.
    #
    # Until a capability is documented here as supported, enabling it may result
    # in undocumented behavior and a future release may update with incompatible
    # behavior <em>without warning or deprecation</em>.

    # ===== Thread safety
    # >>>
    #   *Note:* Access to the responses hash is synchronized for thread-safety.
    #   The receiver thread and response_handlers cannot process new responses
    #   until the block completes.  Accessing either the response hash or its
    #   response type arrays outside of the block is unsafe.  They can be safely
    #   updated inside the block.  Consider using #clear_responses or
    #   #extract_responses instead.
    #
    #   Net::IMAP will add and remove responses from the responses hash and its
    #   array values, in the calling threads for commands and in the receiver
    #   thread, but will not modify any responses after adding them to the
    #   responses hash.
    #
    # ===== Clearing responses
    #
    # Previously unhandled responses are automatically cleared before entering a
    # mailbox with #select or #examine.  Long-lived connections can receive many
    # unhandled server responses, which must be pruned or they will continually
    # consume more memory.  Update or clear the responses hash or arrays inside
    # the block, or remove responses with #extract_responses, #clear_responses,
    # or #add_response_handler.
    #
    # ===== Missing responses
    #
    # Only non-+nil+ data is stored.  Many important response codes have no data
    # of their own, but are used as "tags" on the ResponseText object they are
    # attached to.  ResponseText will be accessible by its response types:
    # "+OK+", "+NO+", "+BAD+", "+BYE+", or "+PREAUTH+".
    #
    # TaggedResponse#data is not saved to #responses, nor is any
    # ResponseCode#data on tagged responses.  Although some command methods do
    # return the TaggedResponse directly, #add_response_handler must be used to
    # handle all response codes.
