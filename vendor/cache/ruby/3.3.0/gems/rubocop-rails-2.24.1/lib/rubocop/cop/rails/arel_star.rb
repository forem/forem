      # Prevents usage of `"*"` on an Arel::Table column reference.
      #
      # Using `arel_table["*"]` causes the outputted string to be a literal
      # quoted asterisk (e.g. <tt>`my_model`.`*`</tt>). This causes the
      # database to look for a column named <tt>`*`</tt> (or `"*"`) as opposed
      # to expanding the column list as one would likely expect.
      #
      # @safety
      #   This cop's autocorrection is unsafe because it turns a quoted `*` into
      #   an SQL `*`, unquoted. `*` is a valid column name in certain databases
      #   supported by Rails, and even though it is usually a mistake,
      #   it might denote legitimate access to a column named `*`.
      #
      # @example
      #   # bad
      #   MyTable.arel_table["*"]
      #
      #   # good
      #   MyTable.arel_table[Arel.star]
      #
      class ArelStar < Base
