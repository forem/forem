      # Checks if the length of a block exceeds some maximum value.
      # Comment lines can optionally be ignored.
      # The maximum allowed length is configurable.
      # The cop can be configured to ignore blocks passed to certain methods.
      #
      # You can set constructs you want to fold with `CountAsOne`.
      # Available are: 'array', 'hash', 'heredoc', and 'method_call'. Each construct
      # will be counted as one line regardless of its actual size.
      #
      # NOTE: This cop does not apply for `Struct` definitions.
      #
      # NOTE: The `ExcludedMethods` configuration is deprecated and only kept
      # for backwards compatibility. Please use `AllowedMethods` and `AllowedPatterns`
      # instead. By default, there are no methods to allowed.
