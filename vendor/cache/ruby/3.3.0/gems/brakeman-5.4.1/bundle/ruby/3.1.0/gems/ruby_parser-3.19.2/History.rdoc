  * Renamed token_buffer to string_buffer since that arcane shit still needs it.
  * Resolved the rest of the lexing issues I brought up w/ ruby-core.
  * Revamped tokadd_escape.
  * Rewrote Keyword and KWtable.
  * Rewrote RubyLexer using StringScanner.
  * Rewrote tokadd_escape. 79 lines down to 21.
  * Split out lib/ruby_parser_extras.rb so lexer is standalone.
  * Started to clean up the parser and make it as skinny as possible
  * Stripped out as much code as possible.
  * Stripped yylex of some dead code.
  * Switched from StringIO to StringScanner.
  * Updated rakefile for new hoe.
  * Uses pure ruby racc if ENV['PURE_RUBY'], otherwise use c.
  * Wrote a ton of lexer tests. Coverage is as close to 100% as possible.
  * Wrote args to clean up the big nasty args processing grammar section.
  * lex_strterm is now a plain array, removed RubyLexer#s(...).
  * yield and super now flatten args.

* 21 bug fixes:

  * I'm sure this list is missing a lot:
  * Fixed 2 bugs both involving attrasgn (and ilk) esp when lhs is an array.
  * Fixed a bug in the lexer for strings with single digit hex escapes.
  * Fixed a bug parsing: a (args) { expr }... the space caused a different route to be followed and all hell broke loose.
  * Fixed a bug with x\n=beginvar not putting begin back.
  * Fixed attrasgn to have arglists, not arrays.
  * Fixed bug in defn/defs with block fixing.
  * Fixed class/module's name slot if colon2/3.
  * Fixed dstr with empty interpolation body.
  * Fixed for 1.9 string/char changes.
  * Fixed lexer BS wrt determining token type of words.
  * Fixed lexer BS wrt pass through values and lexing words. SO STUPID.
  * Fixed lexing of floats.
  * Fixed lexing of identifiers followed by equals. I hope.
  * Fixed masgn with splat on lhs
  * Fixed new_super to deal with block_pass correctly.
  * Fixed parser's treatment of :colon2 and :colon3.
  * Fixed regexp scanning of escaped numbers, ANY number is valid, not just octs.
  * Fixed string scanning of escaped octs, allowing 1-3 chars.
  * Fixed unescape for \n
  * Fixed: omg this is stupid. '()' was returning bare nil
  * Fixed: remove_begin now goes to the end, not sure why it didn't before.

=== 1.0.0 / 2007-12-20
