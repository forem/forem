      - I believe consistency and orthogonality are tools of design, not the primary
        goal in design.
      - From the viewpoint of what you can do, therefore, languages do differ - but
        the differences are limited. For example, Python and Ruby provide almost the
        same power to the programmer.
      - The orthogonal features, when combined, can explode into complexity.
      - I didn't work hard to make Ruby perfect for everyone, because you feel differently
        from me. No language can be perfect for everyone. I tried to make Ruby perfect
        for me, but maybe it's not perfect for you. The perfect language for Guido
        van Rossum is probably Python.
      - Because of the Turing completeness theory, everything one Turing-complete
        language can do can theoretically be done by another Turing-complete language,
        but at a different cost. You can do everything in assembler, but no one wants
        to program in assembler anymore.
      - Ruby inherited the Perl philosophy of having more than one way to do the same
        thing. I inherited that philosophy from Larry Wall, who is my hero actually.
        I want to make Ruby users free. I want to give them the freedom to choose.
      - You want to enjoy life, don't you? If you get your job done quickly and your
        job is fun, that's good isn't it? That's the purpose of life, partly. Your
        life is better.
      - People are different. People choose different criteria. But if there is a
        better way among many alternatives, I want to encourage that way by making
        it comfortable. So that's what I've tried to do.
      - In our daily lives as programmers, we process text strings a lot. So I tried
        to work hard on text processing, namely the string class and regular expressions.
        Regular expressions are built into the language and are very tuned up for
        use.
      - Most of the tasks we do are for humans. For example, a tax calculation is
        counting numbers so the government can pull money out from my wallet, but
        government consists of humans.
      - Actually, I didn't make the claim that Ruby follows the principle of least
        surprise. Someone felt the design of Ruby follows that philosophy, so they
        started saying that. I didn't bring that up, actually.
      - Smart people underestimate the ordinarity of ordinary people.
      - Language designers want to design the perfect language. They want to be able
        to say, 'My language is perfect. It can do everything.' But it's just plain
        impossible to design a perfect language, because there are two ways to look
        at a language. One way is by looking at what can be done with that language.
        The other is by looking at how we feel using that language-how we feel while
        programming.
      - I believe that the purpose of life is, at least in part, to be happy. Based
        on this belief, Ruby is designed to make programming not only easy but also
        fun. It allows you to concentrate on the creative side of programming, with
        less stress.
      - Most programs are not write-once. They are reworked and rewritten again and
        again in their lived. Bugs must be debugged. Changing requirements and the
        need for increased functionality mean the program itself may be modified on
        an ongoing basis. During this process, human beings must be able to read and
        understand the original code. It is therefore more important by far for humans
        to be able to understand the program than it is for the computer.
      - I hope to see Ruby help every programmer in the world to be productive, and
        to enjoy programming, and to be happy. That is the primary purpose of Ruby
        language.
      - Man is driven to create; I know I really love to create things. And while
        I'm not good at painting, drawing, or music, I can write software.
      - It is not the responsibility of the language to force good looking code, but
        the language should make good looking code possible.
      - Plant a memory, plant a tree, do it today for tomorrow.
      - Imagine you are writing an email. You are in front of the computer. You are
        operating the computer, clicking a mouse and typing on a keyboard, but the
        message will be sent to a human over the internet. So you are working before
        the computer, but with a human behind the computer.
      - Often people, especially computer engineers, focus on the machines. But in
        fact we need to focus on humans, on how humans care about doing programming
        or operating the application of the machines.
      - Everyone has an individual background. Someone may come from Python, someone
        else may come from Perl, and they may be surprised by different aspects of
        the language. Then they come up to me and say, 'I was surprised by this feature
        of the language, so therefore Ruby violates the principle of least surprise.'
        Wait. Wait. The principle of least surprise is not for you only.
      - Sometimes people jot down pseudo-code on paper. If that pseudo-code runs directly
        on their computers, its best, isn't it? Ruby tries to be like that, like pseudo-code
        that runs. Python people say that too.

      yoda:
      - Use your feelings, Obi-Wan, and find him you will.
      - Already know you that which you need.
      - Adventure. Excitement. A Jedi craves not these things.
      - At an end your rule is, and not short enough it was!
      - Around the survivors a perimeter create.
      - Soon will I rest, yes, forever sleep. Earned it I have. Twilight is upon me,
        soon night must fall.
      - Not if anything to say about it I have
      - Through the Force, things you will see. Other places. The future - the past.
        Old friends long gone.
      - Ow, ow, OW! On my ear you are!
      - The dark side clouds everything. Impossible to see the future is.
      - Size matters not. Look at me. Judge me by my size, do you? Hmm? Hmm. And well
        you should not. For my ally is the Force, and a powerful ally it is. Life
        creates it, makes it grow. Its energy surrounds us and binds us. Luminous
        beings are we, not this crude matter. You must feel the Force around you;
        here, between you, me, the tree, the rock, everywhere, yes. Even between the
        land and the ship.
      - Younglings, younglings gather ’round.
      - Luminous beings are we - not this crude matter.
      - Clear your mind must be, if you are to find the villains behind this plot.
      - Always two there are, no more, no less. A master and an apprentice.
      - Do. Or do not. There is no try.
      - Much to learn you still have my old padawan. ... This is just the beginning!
      - Good relations with the Wookiees, I have.
      - Ready are you? What know you of ready? For eight hundred years have I trained
        Jedi. My own counsel will I keep on who is to be trained. A Jedi must have
        the deepest commitment, the most serious mind. This one a long time have I
        watched. All his life has he looked away - to the future, to the horizon.
        Never his mind on where he was. Hmm? What he was doing. Hmph. Adventure. Heh.
        Excitement. Heh. A Jedi craves not these things. You are reckless.
      - Truly wonderful, the mind of a child is.
      - Always pass on what you have learned.
      - Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny,
        consume you it will.
      - Mudhole? Slimy? My home this is!
      - Yes, a Jedi’s strength flows from the Force. But beware of the dark side.
        Anger, fear, aggression; the dark side of the Force are they. Easily they
        flow, quick to join you in a fight. If once you start down the dark path,
        forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will, as it did Obi-Wan’s
        apprentice.
      - Do not assume anything Obi-Wan. Clear your mind must be if you are to discover
        the real villains behind this plot.
      - Death is a natural part of life. Rejoice for those around you who transform
        into the Force. Mourn them do not. Miss them do not. Attachment leads to jealously.
        The shadow of greed, that is.
      - Like fire across the galaxy the Clone Wars spread. In league with the wicked
        Count Dooku, more and more planets slip. Against this threat, upon the Jedi
        Knights falls the duty to lead the newly formed army of the Republic. And
        as the heat of war grows, so, to, grows the prowess of one most gifted student
        of the Force.
      - Hmm. In the end, cowards are those who follow the dark side.
      - Strong is Vader. Mind what you have learned. Save you it can.
      - Pain, suffering, death I feel. Something terrible has happened. Young Skywalker
        is in pain. Terrible pain
      - Difficult to see. Always in motion is the future...
      - You will find only what you bring in.
      - Feel the force!
      - Reckless he is. Matters are worse.
      - That is why you fail.
      - Your weapons, you will not need them.
      - To answer power with power, the Jedi way this is

      - This cookie senses that you are superstitious; it is an inclination that is
        bad for your mental health.
      - Goodness comes to those who wait.
      - Two wrongs do not make a right.
      - A rolling stone gathers no moss.
      - Destiny is what you choose it to be; fate is what happens when you relinquish
        your freedom
      - Failure is fuel for victory
      - A black cat is not bad luck for a blind man.
      - To hesitate is to be lost.
