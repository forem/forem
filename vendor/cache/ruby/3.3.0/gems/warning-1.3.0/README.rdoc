= ruby-warning

ruby-warning adds custom processing for warnings, including the
ability to ignore specific warning messages, ignore warnings
in specific files/directories, include backtraces with warnings,
treat warnings as errors, deduplicate warnings, and add
custom handling for all warnings in specific files/directories.

ruby-warning requires ruby 2.4+, as previous versions of ruby do
not support custom processing of warnings.

= Installation

  gem install warning

= Usage 

By default, requiring the library does not make changes to how ruby processes
warnings, it just adds methods that allow you to customize the processing.

<tt>Warning.ignore</tt> takes a regexp and optionally a path prefix, and ignores
any warning that matches the regular expression if it starts with the path
prefix.  It can also take a symbol or an array of symbols, and will use an
appropriate regexp.  The supported symbols are:

* :arg_prefix
* :ambiguous_slash
* :bignum
* :fixnum
* :keyword_separation
* :method_redefined
* :mismatched_indentations
* :missing_gvar
* :missing_ivar
* :not_reached
* :safe
* :shadow
* :taint
* :unused_var
* :useless_operator
* :void_context

<tt>Warning.process</tt> takes an optional path prefix and a block, and if the
warning string starts with the path prefix, it calls the block with the warning
string instead of performing the default behavior. You can call
<tt>Warning.process</tt> multiple times and it will operate intelligently,
choosing the longest path prefix that the string starts with.

<tt>Warning.process</tt> blocks can return +:default+ to use the default
behavior, +:backtrace+ to use the default behavior and also print the backtrace
or +:raise+ to raise the warning string as a RuntimeError.

<tt>Warning.process</tt> can also accept a hash of actions instead of a block,
with keys being regexps (or symbols supported by <tt>Warning.ignore</tt>) and
values being callable objects (or +:default+, +:backtrace+, or +:raise+).

<tt>Warning.dedup</tt> deduplicates warnings, so that if a warning is received
that is the same as a warning that has already been processed, the warning is
ignored. Note that this should be used with care, since if the application
generates an arbitrary number of unique warnings, that can lead to unbounded
memory growth.

<tt>Warning.clear</tt> resets the library to its initial state, clearing the
current ignored warnings and warning processors, and turning off deduplication.

By using path prefixes, it's fairly easy for a gem to set that specific warnings
should be ignored inside the gem's directory.

Note that path prefixes will not correctly handle warnings raised by
<tt>Kernel#warn</tt>, unless the warning message given to <tt>Kernel#warn</tt>
starts with the filename where the warning is used. The <tt>Kernel#warn</tt>
+:uplevel+ option will make sure the warning starts with the filename.

Note that many of the warnings this library can ignore are warnings caused
during compilation (i.e. when files are loaded via require).  You should
require this library and setup the appropriate warning handling before
loading any code that could cause warnings.

= Examples

  # Ignore all uninitialized instance variable warnings
  Warning.ignore(/instance variable @\w+ not initialized/)

  # Ignore all uninitialized instance variable warnings in current file
  Warning.ignore(/instance variable @\w+ not initialized/, __FILE__)

  # Ignore all uninitialized instance variable warnings in current file
  Warning.ignore(:missing_ivar, __FILE__)

  # Ignore all Fixnum and Bignum warnings in current file
  Warning.ignore([:fixnum, :bignum], __FILE__)

  # Write warning to LOGGER at level warning
  Warning.process do |warning|
    LOGGER.warning(warning)
  end

  # Write warnings in the current file to LOGGER at level error
  Warning.process(__FILE__) do |warning|
    LOGGER.error(warning)
  end

  # Write warnings in the current file to $stderr, but include backtrace
  Warning.process(__FILE__) do |warning|
    :backtrace
  end

  # Raise warnings in the current file as RuntimeErrors, with the warning
  # string as the exception message
  Warning.process(__FILE__) do |warning|
    :raise
  end

  # Raise keyword argument separation warnings in the current file as
  # RuntimeErrors, and write ambiguous slash warnings to $stderr, including
  # the backtrace
  Warning.process(__FILE__, keyword_separation: :raise,
                  ambiguous_slash: :backtrace)

  # Deduplicate warnings
  Warning.dedup

  # Ignore all warnings in Gem dependencies
  Gem.path.each do |path|
    Warning.ignore(//, path)
  end
