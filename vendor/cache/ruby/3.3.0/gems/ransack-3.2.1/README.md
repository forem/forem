# SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT

Please see the [Ransack Blog](https://activerecord-hackery.github.io/ransack/blog) for a special announcement from the Ransack maintainers and Ernie Miller, the original author of Ransack.


# Introduction

Ransack will help you easily add **searching to your Rails application**, without any additional dependencies.

There are advanced searching solutions around, like ElasticSearch or Algolia. **Ransack** will do the job for many Rails websites, without the need to run additional infrastructure or work in a different language. With Ransack you do it all with standard Ruby and ERB.

Ready to move beyond the basics? Use **advanced features** like i18n and extensive configuration options.

Ransack is supported for Rails 7.0, 6.x on Ruby 2.6.6 and later.

## Installation

To install `ransack` and add it to your Gemfile, run

```ruby title='Gemfile'
gem 'ransack'
```

### Bleeding edge

If you would like to use the latest updates not yet published to RubyGems, use the `main` branch:

```ruby title='Gemfile'
gem 'ransack', :github => 'activerecord-hackery/ransack', :branch => 'main'
```

### Documentation

There is [extensive documentation on Ransack](https://activerecord-hackery.github.io/ransack/), which is a [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) project and run as a GitHub Pages site.
