Thank you for taking the time to report bugs!

We love code snippets and links to repositories that reproduce the issue, but understand if you don't have the time to add them. We'll do our best with the info you provide, and might ask follow-up questions.

Please see our [OSS process document](https://github.com/honeycombio/home/blob/main/honeycomb-oss-lifecycle-and-practices.md#) to get an idea of how we operate.
