 * This file consist of many small  parts of codes copyrighted by each authors,
 * not  only  the  ``I''  person.   Those  original  authors  agree  with  some
 * open-source license.  I  believe that the license we agree  is the condition
 * mentioned in  the file COPYING.  It  states "4.  You may  modify and include
 * the part of the software into any  other software ...".  But the problem is,
 * the license never makes it clear if  such modified parts still remain in the
 * same  license, or  not.   The fact  that  we agree  with  the source  code's
 * licensing terms do not automatically define that of generated ones.  This is
 * the reason  why this file  is under unclear situation.   All that I  know is
 * that above provision guarantees this file to exist.
 *
 * Please let me  hesitate to declare something about this  nuanced contract. I
 * am not in the position to take  over other authors' license to merge into my
 * one.  Changing them to (say) GPLv3  is not doable by myself. Perhaps someday
 * it might turn out to be okay to say this file is under a license. I wish the
 * situation would become more clear in the future. */
