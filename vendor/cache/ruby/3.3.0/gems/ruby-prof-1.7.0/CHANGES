  could happen in rare instances.

1.2.0 (2020-01-23)
=====================
* Fix call stack printer broken in version 1.0.0 (Charlie Savage)
* Ruby 2.7.0 support (Charlie Savage)
* Switch to Windows high precision timer for measuring wall time (Charlie Savage)

=====================
Changes

* Fix crash caused by threads being freed when profiles are freed (Charlie Savage)

1.0.0 (2019-07-29)
=====================
ruby-prof's development stretches all the way back to 2005. Fourteen years later, it seems time for version 1.0!
Version 1.0 is a significant update that greatly improves the internals of ruby-prof and adds a number of improvements.

Changes (Charlie Savage):

* Profiling is significantly faster - 5x in some cases
* Recursive profiles are finally handled correctly.  Yeah!!!
* Redesigned reports (Chirs Whitefield)
* New documentation website (https://ruby-prof.github.io)
* The ability to measure allocations and memory usage using a standard (unpatched) version of ruby
* The ability to save and reload profiling results for later analysis
* The ability track object allocations

At the same time, it was also time to remove old code and deprecated methods. These changes include (Charlie Savage):

* Drop support for old versions of ruby. Currently 2.4 and up are required.
* Remove support for method elimination (instead use method exclusion).
* Remove the CPU_TIME measurement mode since it duplicates the PROCESS_TIME mode and required inline assembly code
* Remove the GC_TIME and GC_RUNS measurement modes since they required patched ruby versions. In modern ruby it is possible to reimplement this functionality, but it does not seem of that much value (shout out if you want it back).
* Merge the RubyProf::FlatPrinterWithLineNumbers printer into RubyProf::FlatPrinter.
* Removed support for RUBY_PROF_EDITOR_URI environment variable that specified the link scheme. This features was more confusing then helpful.

0.17.0 (2017-12-17)
=====================
* Changed method/class names produced by the callgrind printer to be more kcachegrind
  friendly (thx to Nelson Gauthier and Ben Hughes, see https://github.com/ruby-prof/ruby-prof/pull/200).
* Recursive instances of a method call are now dtected during profiling (thx to Nelson Gauthier and
  Ben Hughes, see https://github.com/ruby-prof/ruby-prof/pull/201).
* Methods can now be ignored during a profiling run instead of eliminating them
  after a profile run, which has been deprecated (thx to Nelson Gauthier and Ben Hughes,
  see https://github.com/ruby-prof/ruby-prof/pull/202).
* Use RUBY_PROF_EDITOR_URI=emacs to open source code links in the one true editor.
  (thx Alexander Egorov, see https://github.com/ruby-prof/ruby-prof/pull/183 and
  https://github.com/typester/emacs-handler).

  - exclude_threads: an array of threads to ignore when collecting profile data
  - include_threads: an array of threads to include when collecting profile data
  - merge_fibers: whether or not to merge the profile data for all fibers under their creating thread
* overhauled printer for cachegrind profiles:
  - profile data for each thread dumped to a separate file, as kcachegrind does not
    fully implement the cachegrind specification
  - this required a change in interface: it's now necessary to specify a directory
    where to dump the cachegrind files
  - naming convention for cachegrind files changed so that kcachegrind shows them
    all in the open dialog
* improved Rack middleware:
  - it's now possible to use the MultiPrinter
  - new option ignore_existing_threads: will ignore all prexisiting threads
    when profiling a request, except the thread perfoming the request.
  - new option request_thread_only: will ignore all preexisting threads, but also
    all threads spwaned during the execution of the rack request.
  - new option merge_fibers: whether or not to merge the profile data for all fibers under their creating thread

0.7.3 (2008-12-09)
========================
* Fixed compile error with new x86_64 code using GCC.

0.7.2 (2008-12-08)
========================
* Fixed major bug in printing child methods in graph reports.

* Fixes for supporting x86_64 machines (Diego Pettenò)


0.7.1 (2008-11-28)
========================
* Added new AggregateCallTree class for printers to
  make results easier to read.  Take this call sequence
  for example:

   A   B   C
   |   |   |
   Z   A   A
       |   |
       Z   Z

  By default, ruby-prof will show that Z was called by 3 separate
  instances of A.  In an IDE that is helpful but in a text report
  it is not since it makes the report much harder to read.
  As a result, printers now aggregate together callers (and children),
  matching ruby-prof's output from versions prior to 0.7.0.

* Fixes for supporting x86_64 machines (Matt Sanford)


0.7.0 (2008-11-04)
========================

Features
--------
* Added two new methods - RubyProf.resume and RubyProf.pause.
  RubyProf.resume takes an optional block, which ensures that
  RubyProf.pause is called.  For example:

  10.times do |i|
    RubyProf.resume do
      # Some long process
    end
  end

  result = RubyProf.stop

* Added support for profiling tests that use Ruby's built-in
  unit test framework (ie, test derived from
  Test::Unit::TestCase).  To enable profiling simply add
  the following line of code to your test class:

    include RubyProf::Test

  By default, profiling results are written to the current
  processes working directory.  To change this, or other
  profiling options, simply modify the PROFILE_OPTIONS hash
  table as needed.

* Used the new support for profiling test cases to revamp
  the way that Rails profiling works.  For more information
  please refer to RubyProf's documentation.

* Keep track of call stack for each method to enable more
  powerful profile visualizations in Integrated Development
  Environments (Hin Boean, work supported by CodeGear).

* Expose measurements to Ruby (Jeremy Kemper).

* Add support for additional memory measurements modes in Ruby 1.9 (Jeremy Kemper).

* Add support for Lloyd Hilaiel's Ruby patch for measuring total heap size.
   See http://lloydforge.org/projects/ruby. (Jeremy Kemper).


Fixes
-------
* RubyProf.profile no longer crashes if an exception is
  thrown during a profiling run.

* Measure memory in fractional kilobytes rather than rounding down (Jeremy Kemper)


0.6.0 (2008-02-03)
========================

Features
--------
* Added support for ruby 1.9 (Shugo Maeda)

  object (Michael Granger)
* Add new memory profiling mode.  Note this mode depends on a
  patched Ruby interpreter (Alexander Dymo)

Fixes
-------
* Improvements to GraphHtmlPrinter including updated documentation,
  fixes for min_time support, ability to specify templates using
  strings or filenames, and table layout fixes (Makoto Kuwata)
