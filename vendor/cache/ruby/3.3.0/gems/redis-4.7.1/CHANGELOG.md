# Unreleased

# 4.7.1

* Gracefully handle OpenSSL 3.0 EOF Errors (`OpenSSL::SSL::SSLError: SSL_read: unexpected eof while reading`). See #1106
  This happens frequently on heroku-22.

# 4.7.0

* Support single endpoint architecture with SSL/TLS in cluster mode. See #1086.
* `zrem` and `zadd` act as noop when provided an empty list of keys. See #1097.
* Support IPv6 URLs.
* Add `Redis#with` for better compatibility with `connection_pool` usage.
* Fix the block form of `multi` called inside `pipelined`. Previously the `MUTLI/EXEC` wouldn't be sent. See #1073.

# 4.6.0

* Deprecate `Redis.current`.
* Deprecate calling commands on `Redis` inside `Redis#pipelined`. See #1059.
  ```ruby
  redis.pipelined do
    redis.get("key")
  end
  ```

  should be replaced by:

  ```ruby
  redis.pipelined do |pipeline|
    pipeline.get("key")
  end
  ```
* Deprecate calling commands on `Redis` inside `Redis#multi`. See #1059.
  ```ruby
  redis.multi do
    redis.get("key")
  end
  ```

  should be replaced by:

  ```ruby
  redis.multi do |transaction|
    transaction.get("key")
  end
  ```
* Deprecate `Redis#queue` and `Redis#commit`. See #1059.

* Fix `zpopmax` and `zpopmin` when called inside a pipeline. See #1055.
* `Redis#synchronize` is now private like it should always have been.

* Add `Redis.silence_deprecations=` to turn off deprecation warnings.
  If you don't wish to see warnings yet, you can set `Redis.silence_deprecations = true`.
  It is however heavily recommended to fix them instead when possible.
* Add `Redis.raise_deprecations=` to turn deprecation warnings into errors.
  This makes it easier to identitify the source of deprecated APIs usage.
  It is recommended to set `Redis.raise_deprecations = true` in development and test environments.
* Add new options to ZRANGE. See #1053.
* Add ZRANGESTORE command. See #1053.
* Add SCAN support for `Redis::Cluster`. See #1049.
* Add COPY command. See #1053. See #1048.
* Add ZDIFFSTORE command. See #1046.
* Add ZDIFF command. See #1044.
* Add ZUNION command. See #1042.
* Add HRANDFIELD command. See #1040.

# 4.5.1

* Restore the accidential auth behavior of redis-rb 4.3.0 with a warning. If provided with the `default` user's password, but a wrong username,
  redis-rb will first try to connect as the provided user, but then will fallback to connect as the `default` user with the provided password.
  This behavior is deprecated and will be removed in Redis 4.6.0. Fix #1038.

# 4.5.0

* Handle parts of the command using incompatible encodings. See #1037.
* Add GET option to SET command. See #1036.

* Add SMISMEMBER command. See #1031.
* Add EXAT/PXAT options to SET. See #1028.
* Add GETDEL/GETEX commands. See #1024.
* `Redis#exists` now returns an Integer by default, as warned since 4.2.0. The old behavior can be restored with `Redis.exists_returns_integer = false`.
* Fix Redis < 6 detection during connect. See #1025.
* Fix fetching command details in Redis cluster when the first node is unhealthy. See #1026.

# 4.4.0

* Redis cluster: fix cross-slot validation in pipelines. Fix ##1019.
* Add support for `XAUTOCLAIM`. See #1018.
* Properly issue `READONLY` when reconnecting to replicas. Fix #1017.

* Support AUTH command for ACL. See #967.

# 4.2.5

* Optimize the ruby connector write buffering. See #964.

# 4.2.4

* Fix bytesize calculations in the ruby connector, and work on a copy of the buffer. Fix #961, #962.

# 4.2.3

* Use io/wait instead of IO.select in the ruby connector. See #960.
* Use exception free non blocking IOs in the ruby connector. See #926.
* Prevent corruption of the client when an interrupt happen during inside a pipeline block. See #945.

# 4.2.2

* Fix `WATCH` support for `Redis::Distributed`. See #941.
* Fix handling of empty stream responses. See #905, #929.

# 4.2.1

* Fix `exists?` returning an actual boolean when called with multiple keys. See #918.
* Setting `Redis.exists_returns_integer = false` disables warning message about new behaviour. See #920.

# 4.2.0

* Convert commands to accept keyword arguments rather than option hashes. This both help catching typos, and reduce needless allocations.
* Deprecate the synchrony driver. It will be removed in 5.0 and hopefully maintained as a separate gem. See #915.
* Make `Redis#exists` variadic, will return an Integer if called with multiple keys.
* Add `Redis#exists?` to get a Boolean if any of the keys exists.
* `Redis#exists` when called with a single key will warn that future versions will return an Integer.
  Set `Redis.exists_returns_integer = true` to opt-in to the new behavior.
* Support `keepttl` ooption in `set`. See #913.
* Optimized initialization of Redis::Cluster. See #912.
* Accept sentinel options even with string key. See #599.
* Verify TLS connections by default. See #900.
* Make `Redis#hset` variadic. It now returns an integer, not a boolean. See #910.

# 4.1.4

* Alias `Redis#disconnect` as `#close`. See #901.
* Handle clusters with multiple slot ranges. See #894.
* Fix password authentication to a redis cluster. See #889.
* Handle recursive MOVED responses. See #882.
* Increase buffer size in the ruby connector. See #880.
* Fix thread safety of `Redis.queue`. See #878.

  accessed via `Redis#_client`.

* Dropped official support for Ruby < 2.2.2.

# 3.3.5

* Fixed Ruby 1.8 compatibility after backporting `Redis#connection`. See #719.

# 3.3.4 (yanked)

* `Redis#connection` returns a hash with connection information.
  You shouldn't need to call `Redis#_client`, ever.

* Added support for `BITPOS` command (Redis 2.9.11, #412).

* The client will now automatically reconnect after a fork (#414).

* If you want to disable the fork-safety check and prefer to share the
  connection across child processes, you can now pass the `inherit_socket`
  option (#409).

* If you want the client to attempt to reconnect more than once, you can now
  pass the `reconnect_attempts` option (#347)

# 3.0.3

* Blocking list commands (`BLPOP`, `BRPOP`, `BRPOPLPUSH`) use a socket
  timeout equal to the sum of the command's timeout and the Redis
  client's timeout, instead of disabling socket timeout altogether.

* Ruby 2.0 compatibility.

* Added support for `DUMP` and `RESTORE` (Redis 2.6).

* Added support for `BITCOUNT` and `BITOP` (Redis 2.6).

* Call `#to_s` on value argument for `SET`, `SETEX`, `PSETEX`, `GETSET`,
  `SETNX`, and `SETRANGE`.

* Fix reconnect logic not kicking in on a write error.

    See 427dbd52928af452f35aa0a57b621bee56cdcb18 and #238.

# 3.0.0

### Upgrading from 2.x to 3.0

The following items are the most important changes to review when
upgrading from redis-rb 2.x. A full list of changes can be found below.

* The methods for the following commands have changed the arguments they
  take, their return value, or both.

    * `BLPOP`, `BRPOP`, `BRPOPLPUSH`
    * `SORT`
    * `MSETNX`
    * `ZRANGE`, `ZREVRANGE`, `ZRANGEBYSCORE`, `ZREVRANGEBYSCORE`
    * `ZINCRBY`, `ZSCORE`

* The return value from `#pipelined` and `#multi` no longer contains
  unprocessed replies, but the same replies that would be returned if
  the command had not been executed in these blocks.

* The client raises custom errors on connection errors, instead of
  `RuntimeError` and errors in the `Errno` family.

### Changes

* Added support for scripting commands (Redis 2.6).

    Scripts can be executed using `#eval` and `#evalsha`. Both can
    commands can either take two arrays to specify `KEYS` and `ARGV`, or
    take a hash containing `:keys` and `:argv` to specify `KEYS` and
    `ARGV`.

    ```ruby
    redis.eval("return ARGV[1] * ARGV[2]", :argv => [2, 3])
      # => 6
    ```

    Subcommands of the `SCRIPT` command can be executed via the
    `#script` method.

    For example:

    ```ruby
    redis.script(:load, "return ARGV[1] * ARGV[2]")
      # => "58db5d365a1922f32e7aa717722141ea9c2b0cf3"
    redis.script(:exists, "58db5d365a1922f32e7aa717722141ea9c2b0cf3")
      # => true
    redis.script(:flush)
      # => "OK"
    ```

* The repository now lives at [https://github.com/redis/redis-rb](https://github.com/redis/redis-rb).
  Thanks, Ezra!

* Added support for `PEXPIRE`, `PEXPIREAT`, `PTTL`, `PSETEX`,
  `INCRYBYFLOAT`, `HINCRYBYFLOAT` and `TIME` (Redis 2.6).

* `Redis.current` is now thread unsafe, because the client itself is thread safe.

    In the future you'll be able to do something like:

    ```ruby
    Redis.current = Redis::Pool.connect
    ```

    This makes `Redis.current` actually usable in multi-threaded environments,
    while not affecting those running a single thread.

* Change API for `BLPOP`, `BRPOP` and `BRPOPLPUSH`.

    Both `BLPOP` and `BRPOP` now take a single argument equal to a
    string key, or an array with string keys, followed by an optional
    hash with a `:timeout` key. When not specified, the timeout defaults
    to `0` to not time out.

    ```ruby
    redis.blpop(["list1", "list2"], :timeout => 1.0)
    ```

    `BRPOPLPUSH` also takes an optional hash with a `:timeout` key as
    last argument for consistency. When not specified, the timeout
    defaults to `0` to not time out.

    ```ruby
    redis.brpoplpush("some_list", "another_list", :timeout => 1.0)
    ```

* When `SORT` is passed multiple key patterns to get via the `:get`
  option, it now returns an array per result element, holding all `GET`
  substitutions.

* The `MSETNX` command now returns a boolean.

* The `ZRANGE`, `ZREVRANGE`, `ZRANGEBYSCORE` and `ZREVRANGEBYSCORE` commands
  now return an array containing `[String, Float]` pairs when
  `:with_scores => true` is passed.

    For example:

    ```ruby
    redis.zrange("zset", 0, -1, :with_scores => true)
      # => [["foo", 1.0], ["bar", 2.0]]
    ```

* The `ZINCRBY` and `ZSCORE` commands now return a `Float` score instead
  of a string holding a representation of the score.

* The client now raises custom exceptions where it makes sense.

    If by any chance you were rescuing low-level exceptions (`Errno::*`),
    you should now rescue as follows:

        Errno::ECONNRESET    -> Redis::ConnectionError
        Errno::EPIPE         -> Redis::ConnectionError
        Errno::ECONNABORTED  -> Redis::ConnectionError
        Errno::EBADF         -> Redis::ConnectionError
        Errno::EINVAL        -> Redis::ConnectionError
        Errno::EAGAIN        -> Redis::TimeoutError
        Errno::ECONNREFUSED  -> Redis::CannotConnectError

* Always raise exceptions originating from erroneous command invocation
  inside pipelines and MULTI/EXEC blocks.

    The old behavior (swallowing exceptions) could cause application bugs
    to go unnoticed.

* Implement futures for assigning values inside pipelines and MULTI/EXEC
  blocks. Futures are assigned their value after the pipeline or
  MULTI/EXEC block has executed.

    ```ruby
    $redis.pipelined do
      @future = $redis.get "key"
    end

    puts @future.value
    ```

* Ruby 1.8.6 is officially not supported.

* Support `ZCOUNT` in `Redis::Distributed` (Michael Dungan).

* Pipelined commands now return the same replies as when called outside
  a pipeline.

    In the past, pipelined replies were returned without post-processing.

* Support `SLOWLOG` command (Michael Bernstein).

* Calling `SHUTDOWN` effectively disconnects the client (Stefan Kaes).

* Basic support for mapping commands so that they can be renamed on the
  server.

* Connecting using a URL now checks that a host is given.

    It's just a small sanity check, cf. #126

* Support variadic commands introduced in Redis 2.4.

# 2.2.2

* Added method `Redis::Distributed#hsetnx`.

# 2.2.1

* Internal API: Client#call and family are now called with a single array
  argument, since splatting a large number of arguments (100K+) results in a
  stack overflow on 1.9.2.

* The `INFO` command can optionally take a subcommand. When the subcommand is
  `COMMANDSTATS`, the client will properly format the returned statistics per
  command. Subcommands for `INFO` are available since Redis v2.3.0 (unstable).

* Change `IO#syswrite` back to the buffered `IO#write` since some Rubies do
  short writes for large (1MB+) buffers and some don't (see issue #108).

# 2.2.0

* Added method `Redis#without_reconnect` that ensures the client will not try
  to reconnect when running the code inside the specified block.

* Thread-safe by default. Thread safety can be explicitly disabled by passing
  `:thread_safe => false` as argument.

* Commands called inside a MULTI/EXEC no longer raise error replies, since a
  successful EXEC means the commands inside the block were executed.

* MULTI/EXEC blocks are pipelined.

* Don't disconnect on error replies.

* Use `IO#syswrite` instead of `IO#write` because write buffering is not
  necessary.

* Connect to a unix socket by passing the `:path` option as argument.

* The timeout value is coerced into a float, allowing sub-second timeouts.

* Accept both `:with_scores` _and_ `:withscores` as argument to sorted set
  commands.

* Use [hiredis](https://github.com/pietern/hiredis-rb) (v0.3 or higher) by
  requiring "redis/connection/hiredis".

* Use [em-synchrony](https://github.com/igrigorik/em-synchrony) by requiring
  "redis/connection/synchrony".

# 2.1.1
