# Integration Tests

To understand integration tests lets understand the puprose of a unit
test. A unit test is about testing in isolate a single funtion and all
of its possible output.

An integration test is when you need to test the result of multiple of
functions or systems.

An integration test may seem similar to a user acceptance test. A
user acceptance test is from the perceptive of the end-user where an
integration test is from the perceptive of the developer.

Integration tests can be found in

`spec/requests/`
