# Forking the repository

The first step in contributing to any Open Source project on GitHub is
[forking][forking] so that you can create [Pull Requests][pull_requests]. If
you're not familiar with the idea of forking a repository, [GitHub has a super
simple tutorial][forking_tutorial]!

If you're ready to get started, [fork Forem's repository][fork_dev]!

Once you've got a fork on GitHub, you can clone your fork to run the project
locally:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/forem.git
```

As time goes on, you may need to refresh your fork. If you have trouble with
that, you can read about [keeping a fork caught up on Forem][refresh_your_fork]!
