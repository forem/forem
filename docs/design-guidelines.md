## Inspiration

DEV's design inspiration is meant to be a throwback with **cult appeal**. In personality and design it is ATARI inspired. Magazines like PAPER are also an inspiration in terms of being a [bold contrast with some more indy](https://www.google.com/search?biw=1440&bih=780&tbm=isch&sa=1&ei=KSN8W5WVLoy55gLI77TgBA&q=paper+magazine+cover&oq=paper+magazine+cover).

We also think in terms of how people use the DEV brand for their own purposes.  Profiles are very much public-facing records of what people have put out into the world. `dev.to/{username}` is your dev identity. 

Imagine a developer’s face with the DEV heading above them. If we existed in the 80’s we would be DEV MAGAZINE, with the exact same branding.
