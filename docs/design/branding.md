# Branding Guidelines

## Forem Theme

Forem's design inspiration is meant to be a throwback. In personality and
design, it is ATARI inspired. Magazines like PAPER are also an inspiration in
terms of being a
[bold contrast with some more indy](https://www.google.com/search?biw=1440&bih=780&tbm=isch&sa=1&ei=KSN8W5WVLoy55gLI77TgBA&q=paper+magazine+cover&oq=paper+magazine+cover).

We also think in terms of how people use the Forem brand for their own purposes.
Profiles are very much public-facing records of what people have put out into
the world. `dev.to/{username}` is your developer identity.

Imagine a developer's face with the DEV heading above them. If we existed in the
80's, we would have been "DEV MAGAZINE," with the exact same branding.

## Branding Rules

- [Joystick](http://www.pixelsagas.com/?download=joystick) should be used for
  logos, not for headlines/phrases.
- Black and white is our default logo, but the logo can be drawn in any color.
- Forem/DEV is "old school cool."
- We use bold shadows (no gradient) for boxes.
- We have a minimal approach to importing dependencies, so few if any custom
  fonts on-site for that reason.
- Refer to the `variables.scss`
  [file in our main repo](https://github.com/forem/forem/blob/main/app/assets/stylesheets/variables.scss)
  to reference commonly-used colors and fonts.

## Design License Info

- We use the [Joystick](http://www.pixelsagas.com/?download=joystick) font by
  Neale Davidson and [Pixel Sagas](http://www.pixelsagas.com/) for the DEV Logo.
  We have a commercial license.
- We use [EmojiOne](https://www.emojione.com/) icons from JoyPixels. We have a
  commercial license.
