# GitPod

If you prefer working on a cloud IDE, you can spin up your own instance of DEV in the cloud, using [GitPod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/thepracticaldev/dev.to).

You can find more information about this, [in a DEV's article](https://dev.to/ben/spin-up-a-local-instance-of-dev-in-the-cloud-with-gitpod-it-s-incredibly-simple-pij).
