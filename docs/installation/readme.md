# Installation Guide

There are many different ways you can install the **development enviroment** so you can help contribute code to DEV.to.

## Installing Locally

You can install DEV.to to your local machine and we have instructions for [Mac](/installation/mac-os), [Windows](/installation/windows) and [Linux](/installation/linux)

## Running Docker

Installing to your local machine can be troublesome for many reasons such as conflicting database and runtime versions. Another way you can get a development enviroment up and running is with Docker. Docker will install everything you need in an isolated enviroment and you need not concern about the details.

We have instructions for installing with [Docker](/installation/docker)

## GitPod

If you are having trouble with local installation and Docker confuses you then you can launch a **development enviroment** with the press of a button with GitPod. GitPod is an IDE in the cloud which is also attached to a web-server. It will install everything you need. If you are confortable doing everything from a web-browser than we have instructions for installing with [GitPod](/installation/gitpod)
