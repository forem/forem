# Installation Guide

There are many different ways you can install the **development environment** so
you can help contribute code to DEV.

## Installing locally

You can install DEV to your local machine and we have instructions for
[Mac](/installation/mac), [Windows](/installation/windows) and
[Linux](/installation/linux).

## Running Docker

Installing to your local machine can be troublesome for many reasons such as a
conflicting database and runtime versions.

Another way you can get a development environment up and running is with Docker.
Docker will install everything you need in an isolated container, and you need
not concern about the details. We have instructions for installing with
[Docker](/installation/docker).

## GitPod _- beginner friendly!_

If you are having trouble with local installation and Docker confuses you, then
you can launch a **development environment** with the press of a button with
GitPod.

GitPod is an IDE in the cloud which is also attached to a web server. It will
install everything you need. If you are comfortable doing everything from a web
browser, then we have instructions for installing with
[GitPod](/installation/gitpod) as well.
