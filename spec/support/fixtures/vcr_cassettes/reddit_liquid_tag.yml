        few brief predictions for 2019:\n\n* **Cheaper oil = cheaper fares.** Airline
        CEOs spent much of the first half of 2018 predicting (wishing?) that airfare
        will get more expensive, pointing to the rising price of oil. But with the
        price of oil down 40% in last 3 months of 2018, one of the main drivers of
        expensive flights is off the table.\n* **Worldwide economic slowdown is bad
        in general but probably good for airfare.** Many economists are predicting
        slower economic growth in 2019 and 2020. When times are tight, discretionary
        spending like vacations are one of the first items on a family''s budget chopping
        block. Lower demand for plane seats will force the airlines to cut fares in
        an attempt to woo those travelers back.\n* **Hawaii flights are going to get
        even cheaper.** Southwest is set to imminently begin flying from the mainland
        US to Hawaii (and between Hawaiian islands). Other airlines like Alaska, United,
        and American have already been dropping their fares in anticipation, but I
        expect that trend to continue even more in 2019. Plus with free checked bags
        and free changes/cancellations, many flyers will find Southwest''s Hawaii
        flights especially valuable.\n* **Mistake fares will continue.** Mistake fares
        are when an airline or online travel agency like Expedia or Orbitz accidentally
        offers fares that are *significantly* lower than normal. For instance, the
        $130 nonstop roundtrip flight from NYC to Milan that jumpstarted my career
        in cheap flights. Though not common, they show no signs of abating and should
        give flyers more opportunities at rare deals in 2019.\n\n*Proof I\u2019m me:*

        It\u2019s usually not polite to brag but if you\u2019ve gotten a howling deal
        from Scott&amp;#39;s Cheap Flights lately I want to hear where you\u2019re
        going! When I\u2019m not on the road traveling vicariously through you all
        is the tops.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE
        (1ish pm PST):&lt;/strong&gt; Technically it&amp;#39;s been 8 hours but really
        what is time but a social construct. Eff it let&amp;#39;s go another few hours
        what do y&amp;#39;all say? Doing my best to get to as many of your comments
        as I possibly can. You all are the flippin best&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE
        2 (4:30pm PST):&lt;/strong&gt; I just took a coffee bath and I&amp;#39;ve
        got a few more hours to spend with my Reddit family let&amp;#39;s keep this
        going why not&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE
        3 (8pm PST)&lt;/strong&gt;: I wish I could quit you!! I&amp;#39;ve got 90
        minutes left until I can go no more please for the love of god I&amp;#39;ve
        got a family&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE
        4 (10pm PST)&lt;/strong&gt;: Taking a little sleep break. I&amp;#39;ve had
        an absolute blast chatting cheap flights these past 17 hours. Will do my best
        to answer more questions when I wake up :) Leave them in the comment section
        I&amp;#39;ll try to get to as many as I can!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE
        5 (6:30am PST)&lt;/strong&gt;: Tanned. Rested. Ready. Let&amp;#39;s go at
        this for another few hours shall we&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE
        6 (10:30am PST)&lt;/strong&gt;: I am pooped. This has been a blast. Tried
        to get to as many questions as possible; I&amp;#39;ll be doing Facebook Lives
        every couple of weeks to take more questions about cheap flights, travel,
        etc. Much love and may 2019 be another incredible year for cheap flights!!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--

        Uncertainty Principle for flights, is there a way to highlight a deal without
        killing the deal.\n\nThe good news is that we haven''t actually found this
        to be much of a problem in reality. Typically when an airline runs an unadvertised
        sale (like the $400 roundtrip flights from across the US to Europe we regularly
        see) they put a ton of US cities up, a handful of Europe cities, and a ton
        of dates. Working with some theoretical numbers here, let''s say there''s
        100 US cities, 15 Europe cities, and 100 different dates (not atypical at
        all). That means there''s \\~150,000 available flights. Now, on the flip side
        even if we send that deal to millions of members, the likelihood that any
        given person will book any particular deal is extremely low. After all, most

        saying this could *never* be a problem, but I think we''d have to be at least
        10x as big as we are today to start encountering even the penumbra of this
        issue.\n\nAt the end of the day, airlines have a fixed number of seats up

        false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a really great
        question. Almost a Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for flights, is there
        a way to highlight a deal without killing the deal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The
        good news is that we haven&amp;#39;t actually found this to be much of a problem
        in reality. Typically when an airline runs an unadvertised sale (like the
        $400 roundtrip flights from across the US to Europe we regularly see) they
        put a ton of US cities up, a handful of Europe cities, and a ton of dates.
        Working with some theoretical numbers here, let&amp;#39;s say there&amp;#39;s
        100 US cities, 15 Europe cities, and 100 different dates (not atypical at
        all). That means there&amp;#39;s ~150,000 available flights. Now, on the flip
        side even if we send that deal to millions of members, the likelihood that
        any given person will book any particular deal is extremely low. After all,
        most of our members tend to book 2 international flights per year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now,
        not saying this could &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; be a problem, but I think
        we&amp;#39;d have to be at least 10x as big as we are today to start encountering
        even the penumbra of this issue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day,
        airlines have a fixed number of seats up for sale, so we want to make sure

        found several great deals to the UK through you, and have been mightily tempted
        to fly off to Paris at some of the great rates. And this is the only subscription
        besides Prime and Netflix I will pay for. Totally worth it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A
        quick question: Is there a way to focus more on the regular economy deals,
        instead of base economy? A preference I can check? I hate base economy with
        the passion of 1000 suns and generally will pay the extra, which is their
        point, I&amp;#39;m sure. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason":

        class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are your thoughts on loyalty programs through
        airlines? My wife flew to 31 countries last year and we will likely take around
        200 flights this year between the two of us. So far we haven&amp;#39;t been
        sticking to any particular airline, but are wondering if it would be worth
        it for the perks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the record we aren&amp;#39;t spending
        a lot, we just are really good at finding deals (your site, FlySkyHi, etc)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
